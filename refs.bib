	abstract = {Significance
            When we touch one hand with the other, the touch feels less intense than identical touches generated by another person or robot. This is because our brain predicts the contact between our hands and attenuates the expected sensation. Here, we describe how the attenuation of self-touch depends on the experienced ownership of the touching hand. We found that illusory self-touch with a rubber hand that feels like one’s own is attenuated. We also found the reverse: The attenuation of real self-touch is reduced when the rubber hand that feels like one’s own is far from the receiving hand. These findings are important because they demonstrate that sensory predictions and sensory attenuation depend on the sense of ownership of the body.
          , 
            Self-perception depends on the brain’s abilities to differentiate our body from the environment and to distinguish between the sensations generated as a consequence of voluntary movement and those arising from events in the external world. The first process refers to the sense of ownership of our body and relies on the dynamic integration of multisensory (afferent) signals. The second process depends on internal forward models that use (efferent) information from our motor commands to predict and attenuate the sensory consequences of our movements. However, the relationship between body ownership and sensory attenuation driven by the forward models remains unknown. To address this issue, we combined the rubber hand illusion, which allows experimental manipulation of body ownership, and the force-matching paradigm, which allows psychophysical quantification of somatosensory attenuation. We found that a rubber right hand pressing on the left index finger produced somatosensory attenuation but only when the model hand felt like one’s own (illusory self-touch); reversely, the attenuation that was expected to occur during actual self-touch with the real hands was reduced when the participants simultaneously experienced ownership of a rubber right hand that was placed at a distance from their left hand. These results demonstrate that the sense of body ownership determines somatosensory attenuation. From a theoretical perspective, our results are important because they suggest that body ownership updates the internal representation of body state that provides the input to the forward model generating sensory predictions during voluntary action.},

	abstract = {Much of the functioning of the motor system occurs without awareness. Nevertheless, we are aware of some aspects of the current state of the system and we can prepare and make movements in the imagination. These mental representations of the actual and possible states of the system are based on two sources: sensory signals from skin and muscles, and the stream of motor commands that have been issued to the system. Damage to the neural substrates of the motor system can lead to abnormalities in the awareness of action as well as defects in the control of action. We provide a framework for understanding how these various abnormalities of awareness can arise. Patients with phantom limbs or with anosognosia experience the illusion that they can move their limbs. We suggest that these representations of movement are based on streams of motor commands rather than sensory signals. Patients with utilization behaviour or with delusions of control can no longer properly link their intentions to their actions. In these cases the impairment lies in the representation of intended movements. The location of the neural damage associated with these disorders suggests that representations of the current and predicted state of the motor system are in parietal cortex, while representations of intended actions are found in prefrontal and premotor cortex.},

The intentional binding effect refers to the subjective compression of the temporal interval between a voluntary action and its external sensory consequence. Since the ﬁrst report, considerable interest has been generated and a fascinating array of studies has accumulated. Much of the interest in intentional binding comes from the promise to shed light on human agency. In this review we survey studies on intentional binding, focusing, in particular, on the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency (the experience of controlling action to inﬂuence events in the environment). We suggest that, whilst it is yet to be fully explicated, the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency is compelling. We conclude by considering outstanding questions and future directions for research on intentional binding.},

We used priming to modulate the sense of agency for voluntary and involuntary movements, by modifying the content of conscious thought prior to moving. Trials began with the presentation of one of two supraliminal primes, which corresponded to the effect of a voluntary action participants subsequently made. The perceived interval between movement and effect was used as an implicit measure of sense of agency. Primes modulated perceived intervals for both voluntary and involuntary movements, but the modulation was greatest for involuntary movements. A second experiment showed that this modulation depended on prime–movement (temporal) contiguity. We propose that sense of agency is based on a combination of internal motoric signals and external sensory evidence about the source of actions and effects.},

	abstract = {Within the methodologically diverse interdisciplinary research on the minimal self, we identify two movements with seemingly disparate research agendas – cognitive science and cognitive (developmental) robotics. Cognitive science, on the one hand, devises rather abstract models which can predict and explain human experimental data related to the minimal self. Incorporating the established models of cognitive science and ideas from artificial intelligence, cognitive robotics, on the other hand, aims to build embodied learning machines capable of developing a self “from scratch” similar to human infants. The epistemic promise of the latter approach is that, at some point, robotic models can serve as a testbed for directly investigating the mechanisms that lead to the emergence of the minimal self. While both approaches can be productive for creating causal mechanistic models of the minimal self, we argue that building a minimal self is different from understanding the human minimal self. Thus, one should be cautious when drawing conclusions about the human minimal self based on robotic model implementations and vice versa. We further point out that incorporating constraints arising from different levels of analysis will be crucial for creating models that can predict, generate, and causally explain behavior in the real world.},

In our model, habitual behavior emerges from cortico-thalamic shortcut connections, where enhanced habit formation can be linked to faster plasticity in the shortcut or to a stronger feedback from the shortcut to the basal ganglia. We explore two major hypotheses of Tourette pathophysiology—local striatal disinhibition and increased dopaminergic modulation of striatal medium spiny neurons—as causes for altered shortcut activation. Both model changes altered shortcut functioning and resulted in higher rates of responses towards devalued outcomes, similar to what is observed in Tourette patients. We recommend future experimental neuroscientific studies to locate shortcuts between cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops in the human brain and study their potential role in health and disease.},

We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features.

Typically, {RTs} are shorter at the cued compared to uncued locations when the cue has the same color as the target. In contrast, cueing effects are absent or even inverted when cue and target colors are dissimilar. By systematically varying the difference between cue and target color, we calculated a function relating cue color to cueing effects. The width of this function reflects the precision of attentional selection and was compared to the precision of judgments of the target color on a color wheel. The precision of the memory representation was far better than the precision of attentional selection. When the task was made more difficult by increasing the similarity between the target and the nontarget stimuli in the target display, the precision of attentional selection increased, but was still worse than the precision of memory.

This priming effect was originally attributed to a feature weighting mechanism that biases attention toward the target features, and away from the non-target features. However, more recent studies have shown that visual selection is strongly context-dependent: according to a relational account of feature priming, the target color is always encoded relative to the non-target color (e.g., as redder or greener). The present study provides a critical test of this hypothesis, by varying the colors of the search items such that either the relative color or the absolute color of the target always remained constant (or both). The results clearly show that color priming depends on the relative color of a target with respect to the nontargets but not on its absolute color value. Moreover, the observed priming effects did not change over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the visual system encodes colors in a relative manner from the start of the experiment. Taken together, these results strongly support a relational account of feature priming in visual search, and are inconsistent with the dominant feature-based views.},

	abstract = {One of the most widespread views in vision research is that top-down control over visual selection is achieved by tuning attention to a particular feature value (e.g., red/yellow). Contrary to this view, previous spatial cueing studies showed that attention can be tuned to relative features of a search target (e.g., redder): An irrelevant distractor (cue) captured attention when it had the same relative color as the target (e.g., redder), and failed to capture when it had a different relative color, regardless of whether the distractor was similar or dissimilar to the target. The present study tested whether the same effects would be observed for eye movements when observers have to search for a color or shape target and when selection errors were very noticeable (resulting in an erroneous eye movement to the distractor). The results corroborated the previous findings, showing that capture by an irrelevant distractor does not depend on the distractor’s similarity to the target but on whether it matches or mismatches the relative attributes of the search target. Extending on previous work, we also found that participants can be pretrained to select a color target in virtue of its exact feature value. Contrary to the prevalent feature-based view, the results suggest that visual selection is preferentially biased toward the relative attributes of a search target. Simultaneously, however, visual selection can be biased to specific color values when the task requires it, which rules out a purely relational account of attention and eye movements.},

However, unlike laboratory participants, searchers in the real world rarely have perfect knowledge regarding the potential appearance of targets. In seven experiments, we examined how the precision of target templates affects the ability to conduct visual search. Specifically, we degraded template precision in two ways: 1) by contaminating searchers’ templates with inaccurate features, and 2) by introducing extraneous features to the template that were unhelpful. We recorded eye movements to allow inferences regarding the relative extents to which attentional guidance and decision-making are hindered by template imprecision. Our findings support a dual-function theory of the target template and highlight the importance of examining template precision in visual search.},

Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that the tail of the caudate nucleus and extrastriate visual cortex respond preferentially to task-irrelevant but previously reward-associated objects, providing an attentional priority signal that is sensitive to reward history. The caudate tail has not been implicated in the control of goal-directed or stimulus-driven attention, but is well suited to mediate the value-driven control of attention.

This paper proposes a versatile soft sensing glove, using a simple process for preparing sensors of different sizes without molding. We used commercially available silicone tubes to host the conductive liquid. Ten sensors were attached to the back side of the glove to measure ﬂexionextension and four sensors were placed on the glove at the interdigital folds between the ﬁngers to measure abduction-adduction. The sensory glove successfully replicates hand motion. We used machine learning algorithms to estimate the angles of the joints in the hand and also to identify 15 gestures. The system’s robustness was evaluated in two experiments. The gesture prediction is robust to shocks from contact with a punching ball and also submersion of the glove in water. The proposed sensory glove overcomes challenges of comfort, rigidity, and robustness. It can be used, therefore, to replicate human hand motion in industrial and medical applications.},

This paper proposes a framework for motor coordination acquisition of a robot drawing straight lines within a part of the workspace. Then, it addresses transferring the acquired coordination into another area of the workspace while performing the same task. Motor patterns are generated by a Central Pattern Generator ({CPG}) model. The motor coordination for a given task is acquired by using a multi-objective optimization method that adjusts the {CPGs}’ parameters involved in the coordination. To transfer the acquired motor coordination to the whole workspace we employed (1) a Self-Organizing Map that represents the end-effector coordination in the Cartesian space, and (2) an estimation method based on Inverse Distance Weighting that estimates the motor program parameters for each {SOM} neuron. After learning, the robot generalizes the acquired motor program along the {SOM} network. It is able therefore to draw lines from any point in the 2D workspace and with different orientations. Aside from the obvious distinctiveness of the proposed framework from those based on inverse kinematics typically leading to a point-to-point drawing, our approach also permits of transferring the motor program throughout the workspace.},

	abstract = {Significance
            When we touch one hand with the other, the touch feels less intense than identical touches generated by another person or robot. This is because our brain predicts the contact between our hands and attenuates the expected sensation. Here, we describe how the attenuation of self-touch depends on the experienced ownership of the touching hand. We found that illusory self-touch with a rubber hand that feels like one’s own is attenuated. We also found the reverse: The attenuation of real self-touch is reduced when the rubber hand that feels like one’s own is far from the receiving hand. These findings are important because they demonstrate that sensory predictions and sensory attenuation depend on the sense of ownership of the body.
          , 
            Self-perception depends on the brain’s abilities to differentiate our body from the environment and to distinguish between the sensations generated as a consequence of voluntary movement and those arising from events in the external world. The first process refers to the sense of ownership of our body and relies on the dynamic integration of multisensory (afferent) signals. The second process depends on internal forward models that use (efferent) information from our motor commands to predict and attenuate the sensory consequences of our movements. However, the relationship between body ownership and sensory attenuation driven by the forward models remains unknown. To address this issue, we combined the rubber hand illusion, which allows experimental manipulation of body ownership, and the force-matching paradigm, which allows psychophysical quantification of somatosensory attenuation. We found that a rubber right hand pressing on the left index finger produced somatosensory attenuation but only when the model hand felt like one’s own (illusory self-touch); reversely, the attenuation that was expected to occur during actual self-touch with the real hands was reduced when the participants simultaneously experienced ownership of a rubber right hand that was placed at a distance from their left hand. These results demonstrate that the sense of body ownership determines somatosensory attenuation. From a theoretical perspective, our results are important because they suggest that body ownership updates the internal representation of body state that provides the input to the forward model generating sensory predictions during voluntary action.},

To overcome the sensorimotor delays and noise, the brain uses internal forward models to predict the sensory consequences of an action. Here, we investigated whether these sensory predictions are computed similarly for actions involving hand-held tools and natural hand movements. We hypothesized that the predictive attenuation of touch observed when touching one hand with the other would also be observed for touches applied with a hand-held tool. We ﬁrst show that when touch is applied to the left index ﬁnger with the right index ﬁnger, the perceived force sensation is attenuated, only when the ﬁngers are aligned in a manner that simulates direct physical contact and not when a distance of 25 cm is introduced between the hands. We then show that touch applied to the left index ﬁnger with a tool held in the right hand at a distance of 25 cm produces full sensory attenuation, similar to direct ﬁnger-to-ﬁnger contact. Finally, we show that touch is attenuated only when the tip of the tool is aligned with the receiving left index ﬁnger and not when the tip is placed at a distance of 25 cm. Collectively, these results suggest that tool use and natural limb movements share the same computational mechanism for sensory predictions. We submit that the brain uses effector-independent forward models: touch is predicted based on the anticipated position of the current effector (i.e., the tip of the tool) rather than the body part per se.},

We used five tasks to examine the relationships among cardiac awareness, thermosensation, affective touch, and nociception. Thermosensation was probed with a classic temperature detection task and the new dynamic thermal matching task, where par­ ticipants matched perceived moving thermal stimuli in a range of colder/warmer stimuli around thermoneu­ trality. We also examined differences between hairy and non-hairy skin and found superior perception of dynamic temperature and static cooling on hairy skin. Notably, no significant correlations were observed across interoceptive submodality accuracies (except for cold and pain perception in the palm), which indicates that interoception at perceptual levels should be conceptualised as a set of relatively independent processes and abilities rather than a single construct.},

According to theory, this is because the brain predicts and attenuates the somatosensory consequences of our movements using a copy of the motor command, i.e., the efference copy. However, whether the efference copy is necessary for this somatosensory attenuation is unclear. Alternatively, a predictable contact of two body parts could be sufﬁcient. Here we quantiﬁed the attenuation of touch applied on the participants’ left index ﬁnger when the touch was triggered by the active or passive movement of the right index ﬁnger and when it was externally generated. We observed attenuation only when the touch was triggered by the participants’ active movement. In contrast, during the passive movement, the touch was perceived to be as strong as when the touch was externally triggered. Our results suggest that the efference copy is necessary for the attenuation of self-generated touch.},

It is largely accepted that this network allows for multisensory processing of the space surrounding the body (peripersonal space), whose function has been linked to the sensory guidance of appetitive and defensive movements, and localization of the limbs in space. In the current review, we consider multidisciplinary findings about the processing of the space near the hands in humans and offer a convergent view of its functions and underlying neural mechanisms. We will suggest that evolution has provided the brain with a clever tool for representing visual information around the hand, which takes the hand itself as a reference for the coding of surrounding visual space.

To address this issue, we developed a detection-­like psychophysics task based on the classic rubber hand illusion paradigm, where participants were asked to report whether the rubber hand felt like their own (the illusion) or not. We manipulated the asynchrony of visual and tactile stimuli delivered to the rubber hand and the hidden real hand under different levels of visual noise. We found that: (1) the probability of the emergence of the rubber hand illusion increased with visual noise and was well predicted by a causal inference model involving the observer computing the probability of the visual and tactile signals coming from a common source; (2) the causal inference model outperformed a non-B­ ayesian model involving the observer not taking into account sensory uncertainty; (3) by comparing body ownership and visuotactile synchrony detection, we found that the prior probability of inferring a common cause for the two types of multisensory percept was correlated but greater for ownership, which suggests that individual differences in rubber hand illusion can be explained at the computational level as differences in how priors are used in the multisensory integration process.

	abstract = {In the past 2 decades, interoception has received increasing attention in the fields of psychology and cognitive science, as well as neuroscience and physiology. A plethora of studies adopted the perception of cardiac signals as a proxy for interoception. However, recent findings have cast doubt on the methodological and intrinsic validity of the tasks used thus far. Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to improve the existing cardiac interoceptive tasks and to identify novel channels to target the perception of the physiological state of the body. Amid such scientific abundancy, one could question whether the field has been partially neglecting one of our widest organs in terms of dimensions and functions: the skin. According to some views grounded on anatomical and physiological evidence, skin-mediated signals such as affective touch, pain, and temperature have been redefined as interoceptive. However, there is no agreement in this regard. Here, we discuss some of the anatomical, physiological, and experimental arguments supporting the scientific study of interoception by means of skin-mediated signals. We argue that more attention should be paid to the skin as a sensory organ that monitors the bodily physiological state and further propose thermosensation as a particularly attractive model of skin-mediated interoception.},

Thus, a coherent sense of self implies the existence of a tight link between the sense of body ownership and the motor system. Here, we investigated this issue by taking advantage of a well-k­ nown experimental manipulation of body ownership, i.e., the rubber hand illusion ({RHI}), during which the subjects perceive a fake hand as part of their own body. To test the effect of the motor system down-­ regulation on the {RHI} susceptibility, we designed a sham-­controlled study, where the primary motor cortex (M1) excitability was modulated by off-­line low-­frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ({rTMS}). After {rTMS} (real or sham), subjects underwent the {RHI} either on the right hand, contralateral to the inhibited hemisphere (Experiment 1), or on the left hand, ipsilateral to the inhibited hemisphere (Experiment 2). Only in Experiment 1, the procedure strengthened the illusory experience, as proved by a significant increase, in {rTMS} compared to Sham, of both subjective (Embodiment/Disembodiment Questionnaires) and objective (Proprioceptive Drift) {RHI} measures. This evidence demonstrates that, when the M1 activity is down-r­egulated, the sense of body ownership is attenuated and the subjects become more prone to incorporate an alien body part. This, in turn, supports the existence of a mutual interaction between the sense of body ownership and the motor system, shedding new light on the construction of a coherent sense of self as an acting body.},

The leading proposed function has been action understanding: Accordingly, we understand the actions of others by ‘simulating’ them in our own motor system through a direct matching of the visual information to our own motor programmes. Furthermore, it has been proposed that this simulation involves the prediction of the sensory consequences of the observed action, similar to the prediction of the sensory consequences of our executed actions. Here, we tested this proposal by quantifying somatosensory attenuation behaviourally during action observation. Somatosensory attenuation manifests during voluntary action and refers to the perception of self-generated touches as less intense than identical externally generated touches because the self-generated touches are predicted from the motor command. Therefore, we reasoned that if an observer simulates the observed action and, thus, he/she predicts its somatosensory consequences, then he/she should attenuate tactile stimuli simultaneously delivered to his/her corresponding body part. In three separate experiments, we found a systematic attenuation of touches during executed self-touch actions, but we found no evidence for attenuation when such actions were observed. Failure to observe somatosensory attenuation during observation of self-touch is not compatible with the hypothesis that the putative human mirror neuron system automatically predicts the sensory consequences of the observed action. In contrast, our findings emphasize a sharp distinction between the motor representations of self and others.},

At present, researchers often consider gating and attenuation the same suppression process; however, this assumption is unwarranted because, despite more than 40 years of research, no study has combined them in a single paradigm. We quantiﬁed how people perceive self-generated and externally generated touches during movement and rest. We show that whereas voluntary movement gates the precision of both self-generated and externally generated touch, the amplitude of self-generated touch is robustly attenuated compared with externally generated touch.

The current study aimed to elucidate how three-way combinations of correlated visual, tactile and vestibular signals contribute to the senses of body ownership and self-motion. Visuo-tactile temporal congruence was manipulated by touching the mannequin’s body and the participant’s unseen real body on the trunk with a small object either synchronously or asynchronously. Visuo-vestibular temporal congruence was manipulated by synchronous or asynchronous presentation of a visual motion cue (the background rotating around the mannequin in one direction) and galvanic stimulation of the vestibular nerve generating a rotation sensation (in the same direction). The illusory experiences were quantified using a questionnaire; threat-evoked skin-conductance responses ({SCRs}) provided complementary indirect physiological evidence for the illusion. Ratings on the illusion questionnaire statement showed significant main effects of synchronous visuovestibular and synchronous visuo-tactile stimulations, suggesting that both of these pairs of bimodal correlations contribute to the ownership illusion. Interestingly, visuo-tactile synchrony dominated because synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation combined with asynchronous visuo-vestibular stimulation elicited a body ownership illusion of similar strength as when both bimodal combinations were synchronous. Moreover, both visuo-tactile and visuo-vestibular synchrony were associated with enhanced self-motion perception; selfmotion sensations were even triggered when visuo-tactile synchrony was combined with visuo-vestibular asynchrony, suggesting that ownership enhanced the relevance of visual information as a self-motion cue. Finally, the {SCR} results suggest that synchronous stimulation of either modality pair led to a stronger illusion compared to the asynchronous conditions. Collectively, the results suggest that visuo-tactile temporal correlations have a stronger influence on body ownership than visuo-vestibular correlations and that ownership boosts self-motion perception. We present a Bayesian causal inference model that can explain how visuo-vestibular and visuo-tactile information are combined in multisensory own-body perception.},

	abstract = {Bodily illusions have fascinated humankind for centuries, and researchers have studied them to learn about the perceptual and neural processes that underpin multisensory channels of bodily awareness. The influential rubber hand illusion ({RHI}) has been used to study changes in the sense of body ownership: how a limb is perceived to belong to one’s body, which is a fundamental building block in many theories of bodily awareness, self-consciousness, embodiment, and selfrepresentation. However, the methods used to quantify perceptual changes in bodily illusions —including the {RHI} — have mainly relied on subjective questionnaires and rating scales, and the degree to which such illusory sensations depend on sensory information processing has been difficult to test directly. Here we introduce a signal detection theory ({SDT}) framework to study the sense of body ownership in the {RHI}. We provide evidence that the illusion is associated with changes in body ownership sensitivity that depend on the information carried in the degree of asynchrony of correlated visual and tactile signals, as well as perceptual bias and sensitivity that reflect the distance between the rubber hand and the participant’s real body. We found that the illusion’s sensitivity to asynchrony is remarkably precise; even a 50 ms visuo-tactile delay significantly affected body ownership sensitivity. Our findings conclusively link changes in a complex bodily experience such as body ownership to basic sensory information processing and provide a proof of concept that {SDT} can be used to study bodily illusions.},

            Research on motor imagery has identified many similarities between imagined and executed actions at the behavioral, physiological and neural levels, thus supporting their “functional equivalence”. In contrast, little is known about their possible “computational equivalence”—specifically, whether the brain’s internal forward models predict the sensory consequences of imagined movements as they do for overt movements. Here, we address this question by assessing whether imagined self-generated touch produces an attenuation of real tactile sensations. Previous studies have shown that self-touch feels less intense compared with touch of external origin because the forward models predict the tactile feedback based on a copy of the motor command. Our results demonstrate that imagined self-touch is attenuated just as real self-touch is and that the imagery-induced attenuation follows the same spatiotemporal principles as does the attenuation elicited by overt movements. We conclude that motor imagery recruits the forward models to predict the sensory consequences of imagined movements.},

            The neural representation of the body is easily altered by the integration of multiple sensory signals in the brain. The “rubber hand illusion” ({RHI}) is one of the most popular experimental paradigms to investigate this phenomenon. During this illusion, a feeling of ownership of the rubber hand is created. Some studies have shown that somatosensory processing in the brain is attenuated when {RHI} occurs. However, it is unknown where attenuation of somatosensory processing occurs. Here, we show that somatosensory processing is attenuated in the primary somatosensory cortex. We found that the earliest response of somatosensory evoked potentials, which is thought to originate from the primary somatosensory cortex, was attenuated during {RHI}. Furthermore, this attenuation was observed before the occurrence of the illusion. Our results suggest that attenuation of sensory processing in the primary somatosensory cortex is one of the factors influencing the occurrence of the {RHI}.},

            Thermosensation has been redefined as an interoceptive modality that provides information about the homeostatic state of the body. However, the contribution of thermosensory signals to the sense of body ownership remains unclear. Across two rubber hand illusion ({RHI}) experiments (N = 73), we manipulated the visuo-thermal congruency between the felt and seen temperature, on the real and rubber hand respectively. We measured the subjectively experienced {RHI}, the perceived hand location and temperature of touch, and monitored skin temperature. We found that visuo-thermal incongruencies between the seen and felt touch reduced the subjective and behavioural {RHI} experience (Experiment 1). Visuo-thermal incongruencies also gave rise to a visuo-thermal illusion effect, but only when the rubber hand was placed in a plausible position (Experiment 2) and when considering individual differences in interoceptive sensibility. Thus, thermosensation contributes to the sense of body ownership by a mechanism of dynamic integration of visual and thermosensory signals.},

	abstract = {Some recent papers by P. Lush and colleagues have argued that the rubber hand illusion ({RHI}), where participants can feel a rubber hand as their own under appropriate multisensory stimulation, may be caused mainly by hypnotic suggestibility and expectations (demand characteristics). These papers rely primarily on a study with 353 participants who took part in a {RHI} experiment carried out in a classical way with brush stroking. Participants experienced a synchronous condition where the rubber hand was seen to be touched in synchrony with touch felt on their corresponding hidden real hand, or the touches were applied asynchronously as a control. Each participant had a related measure of their hypnotisability on a scale known as the Sussex-Waterloo Scale of Hypnotisability ({SWASH}). The authors found a correlation between the questionnaire ratings of the {RHI} in the synchronous condition and the {SWASH} score. From this, they concluded that the {RHI} is largely driven by suggestibility and further proposed that suggestibility and expectations may even entirely explain the {RHI}. Here we examine their claims in a series of extensive new analyses of their data. We ﬁnd that at every level of {SWASH}, the synchronous stimulation results in greater levels of the illusion than the asynchronous condition; moreover, proprioceptive drift is greater in the synchronous case at every level of {SWASH}. Thus, while the level of hypnotisability does modestly inﬂuence the subjective reports (higher {SWASH} is associated with somewhat higher illusion ratings), the major difference between the synchronous and asynchronous stimulation is always present. Furthermore, by including in the model the participants’ expectancy ratings of how strongly they initially believed they would experience the {RHI} in the two conditions, we show that expectations had a very small effect on the illusion ratings; model comparisons further demonstrate that the multisensory condition is two-to-three-times as dominant as the other factors, with hypnotisability contributing modestly and expectations negligibly. Thus, although the results indicate that trait suggestibility may modulate the {RHI}, presumably through intersubject variations in top-down factors, the ﬁndings also suggest that the primary explanation for the {RHI} is as a multisensory bodily illusion.},

            Agency, the attribution of authorship to an action of our body, requires the intention to carry out the action, and subsequently a match between its predicted and actual sensory consequences. However, illusory agency can be generated through priming of the action together with perception of bodily action, even when there has been no actual corresponding action. Here we show that participants can have the illusion of agency over the walking of a virtual body even though in reality they are seated and only allowed head movements. The experiment (n = 28) had two factors: Perspective (1PP or 3PP) and Head Sway (Sway or {NoSway}). Participants in 1PP saw a life-sized virtual body spatially coincident with their own from a first person perspective, or the virtual body from third person perspective (3PP). In the Sway condition the viewpoint included a walking animation, but not in {NoSway}. The results show strong illusions of body ownership, agency and walking, in the 1PP compared to the 3PP condition, and an enhanced level of arousal while the walking was up a virtual hill. Sway reduced the level of agency. We conclude with a discussion of the results in the light of current theories of agency.},

We observed that tactile-related activity in a region of secondary somatosensory cortex is reduced when sensation is associated with movement and further that this reduction is maximal when movement and sensation occur synchronously. Motor force is not represented in the degree of attenuation but rather in the magnitude of this region's response.

Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multilayer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive {SuperSpike}, a nonlinear voltage-based three-factor learning rule capable of training multilayer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric, and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike time patterns.},

It has proven difficult to uncover single-neuron mechanisms that account for neuronal multiplication. Here we show that multiplicative responses can arise in a network model through population effects. Specifically, neurons in a recurrently connected network with excitatory connections between similarly tuned neurons and inhibitory connections between differently tuned neurons can perform a product operation on additive synaptic inputs.

We model learning in the three major basal ganglia pathways, direct, indirect and hyperdirect, by spike time dependent learning and considering the amount of dopamine available (reward). Moreover, we allow to learn a cortico-thalamic pathway that bypasses the basal ganglia. As a result the system develops new functionalities for the different basal ganglia pathways: The direct pathway selects actions by disinhibiting the thalamus, the hyperdirect one suppresses alternatives and the indirect pathway learns to inhibit common mistakes. Numerical experiments show that the system is capable of learning sets of either deterministic or stochastic rules.},

	abstract = {Theories and models of the basal ganglia have mainly focused on the role of three different corticothalamic pathways: direct, indirect and hyperdirect. Although the indirect and the hyperdirect pathways are linked through the bidirectional connections between the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and the external globus pallidus ({GPe}), the role of their interactions has been mainly discussed in the context of a dysfunction (abnormal oscillations in Parkinson’s disease) and not of its function. We here propose a novel role for the loop formed by the {STN} and the {GPe}. We show, through a neuro-computational model, that this loop can bias the selection of actions during the exploratory period after a change in the environmental conditions towards alternative responses. Testing well-known alternative solutions before completely random actions can reduce the time required for the search of a new response after a rule change. Our simulations further show that the knowledge acquired by the indirect pathway can be transferred into a stable memory via learning in the hyperdirect pathway to establish the blocking of unwanted responses. After a rule switch, ﬁrst the indirect pathway learns to inhibit the previously correct actions. Once the new correct association is learned, the inhibition is transferred to the hyperdirect pathway through synaptic plasticity.},

We introduce here a set of four key concepts, integrated and evaluated by means of a neuro-computational model, that bring together current ideas regarding cortex–basal ganglia interactions in the context of habit learning. According to key concept 1, each loop learns to select an intermediate objective at a different abstraction level, moving from goals in the ventral striatum to motor in the putamen. Key concept 2 proposes that the cortex integrates the basal ganglia selection with environmental information regarding the achieved objective. Key concept 3 claims shortcuts between loops, and key concept 4 predicts that loops compute their own prediction error signal for learning. Computational benefits of the key concepts are demonstrated. Contrasting with former concepts of habit learning, the loops collaborate to select goal-directed actions while training slower shortcuts develops habitual responses.},

Despite its importance, little is known about how this network learns motor tasks and which role different parts of this network take. We designed a systems-level computational model of motor learning, including a cortex-basal ganglia motor loop and the cerebellum that both determine the response of central pattern generators in the brainstem. First, we demonstrate its ability to learn arm movements toward different motor goals. Second, we test the model in a motor adaptation task with cognitive control, where the model replicates human data. We conclude that the cortex-basal ganglia loop learns via a novelty-based motor prediction error to determine concrete actions given a desired outcome, and that the cerebellum minimizes the remaining aiming error.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the basal ganglia ({BG}) play a key role in action selection and reinforcement learning. However, despite considerable number of studies, the {BG} architecture and function are not completely understood. Action selection and reinforcement learning are facilitated by the activity of dopaminergic neurons, which encode reward prediction errors when reward outcomes are higher or lower than expected. The {BG} are thought to select proper motor responses by gating appropriate actions, and suppressing inappropriate ones. The direct striato-nigral ({GO}) and the indirect striato-pallidal ({NOGO}) pathways have been suggested to provide the functions of {BG} in the two-pathway concept. Previous models conﬁrmed the idea that these two pathways can mediate the behavioral choice, but only for a relatively small number of potential behaviors. Recent studies have provided new evidence of {BG} involvement in motor adaptation tasks, in which adaptation occurs in a non-error-based manner. In such tasks, there is a continuum of possible actions, each represented by a complex neuronal activity pattern. We extended the classical concept of the two-pathway {BG} by creating a model of {BG} interacting with a movement execution system, which allows for an arbitrary number of possible actions. The model includes sensory and premotor cortices, {BG}, a spinal cord network, and a virtual mechanical arm performing 2D reaching movements. The arm is composed of 2 joints (shoulder and elbow) controlled by 6 muscles (4 mono-articular and 2 bi-articular). The spinal cord network contains motoneurons, controlling the muscles, and sensory interneurons that receive afferent feedback and mediate basic reﬂexes. Given a speciﬁc goal-oriented motor task, the {BG} network through reinforcement learning constructs a behavior from an arbitrary number of basic actions represented by cortical activity patterns. Our study conﬁrms that, with slight modiﬁcations, the classical two-pathway {BG} concept is consistent with results of previous studies, including non-error based motor adaptation experiments, pharmacological manipulations with {BG} nuclei, and functional deﬁcits observed in {BG}-related motor disorders.},

	abstract = {Basal ganglia are usually attributed a role in facilitating willed action, which is found to be impaired in Parkinson’s disease, a pathology of basal ganglia. We hypothesize that basal ganglia possess the machinery to amplify will signals, presumably weak, by stochastic resonance. Recently we proposed a computational model of Parkinsonian reaching, in which the contributions from basal ganglia aid the motor cortex in learning to reach. The model was cast in reinforcement learning framework. We now show that the above basal ganglia computational model has all the ingredients of stochastic resonance process. In the proposed computational model, we consider the problem of moving an arm from a rest position to a target position: the two positions correspond to two extrema of the value function. A single kick (a half-wave of sinusoid, of sufficiently low amplitude) given to the system in resting position, succeeds in taking the system to the target position, with high probability, only at a critical noise level. But for suboptimal noise levels, the model arm’s movements resemble Parkinsonian movement symptoms like akinetic rigidity (low noise) and dyskinesias (high noise).},

	abstract = {We will describe a computational model of attention which explains the guidance of spatial attention by feedback within a distributed network. We hypothesize that feedback within the ventral pathway transfers the target template from prefrontal areas into intermediate areas like V4. The oculomotor circuit consisting of {FEF}, {LIP} and superior colliculus picks up this distributed activity and provides a continuous spatial reentry signal from premotor cells. In order to test this hypothesis, we simulate two experiments that require a response given a color cue. The ﬁrst experiment indicates a parallel feature-based enhancement prior to any spatial selection. If two targets are behaviorally relevant, as in the second experiment, experimental ﬁndings indicate that subjects split their attention between two locations containing the searched feature. Our simulation results suggest that the split in attention between two foci is a transient eﬀect occurring during competition. We predict that the time after cue presentation determines the state of this competition and ultimately the distribution of attention at diﬀerent locations. In addition we provide simulation results to explain how reentrant processing through the oculomotor circuit might lead to variations of the time for target detection in visual search.},

	abstract = {Background: Attending to the spatial location or to nonspatial features of visual stimuli can modulate neuronal responses in primate visual cortex. The modulation by spatial attention changes the gain of sensory neurons and strengthens the representation of attended locations without changing neuronal selectivities such as directionality, i.e., the ratio of responses to preferred and anti-preferred directions of motion. Whether feature-based attention acts in a similar manner is unknown.
Results: To clarify this issue, we recorded the responses of 135 direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal area ({MT}) of two macaques to an unattended moving random dot pattern (the distractor) positioned inside a neuron’s receptive field while the animals attended to a second moving pattern positioned in the opposite hemifield. Responses to different directions of the distractor were modulated by the same factor (approximately 12\%) as long as the attended direction remained unchanged. On the other hand, systematically changing the attended direction from a neuron’s preferred to its anti-preferred direction caused a systematic change of the attentional modulation from an enhancement to a suppression, increasing directionality by about 20\%.
Conclusions: The results show that (1) feature-based attention exerts a multiplicative modulation upon neuronal responses and that the strength of this modulation depends on the similarity between the attended feature and the cell’s preferred feature, in line with the featuresimilarity gain model, and (2) at the level of the neuronal population, feature-based attention increases the selectivity for attended features by increasing the responses of neurons preferring this feature value while decreasing responses of neurons tuned to the opposite feature value.},

Attention tasks are a prime example to study at the neuronal level, how task related information can be selectively processed in the brain while irrelevant information is ﬁltered out. Whereas, numerous studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of visual attention at the single neuron and population level in the visual cortices, considerably less work has been devoted to deciphering the distinct contribution of higher-order brain areas, which are known to be critical for the employment of attention. Among these areas, the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) has long been considered a source of top-down signals that bias selection in early visual areas in favor of the attended features. Here, we review recent experimental data that support the role of {PFC} in attention. We examine the existing evidence for functional specialization within {PFC} and we discuss how long-range interactions between {PFC} subregions and posterior visual areas may be implemented in the brain and contribute to the attentional modulation of different measures of neural activity in visual cortices.},

	abstract = {The probability of missing a target increases in low target prevalence search tasks. Wolfe and Van Wert (2010) propose 2 causes of this effect: reducing the quitting threshold, and conservatively shifting the decision making criterion used to evaluate each item. Reducing the quitting threshold predicts that target absent responses will be made without fully inspecting the display, increasing misses due to never inspecting the target (selection errors). The shift in decision criterion increases the likelihood of failing to recognize an inspected target (identification errors). Though there is robust evidence that target prevalence rates shift quitting thresholds, the proposed shift in decision making criterion has little support. In Experiment 1 we eye-tracked participants during searches of high, medium, and low prevalence. Eye movements were used to classify misses as selection or identification errors. Identification errors increased as prevalence decreased, supporting the claim that decision criterion becomes more conservative as prevalence decreases. In addition, as prevalence decreased, the dwell time on targets increased while dwell times on distractors decreased. We propose that the effect of prevalence on decision making for individual items is best modeled as a shift in criterion in a drift diffusion model, rather than signal detection, as drift diffusion accounts for this pattern of decision times. In Experiment 2 we replicate these findings while presenting stimuli in an rapid serial visual presentation ({RSVP}) stream. Experiments 1 and 2 were consistent with the conclusion that prevalence rate influences the item-by-item decision criterion, and are consistent with a drift diffusion model of this decision process.},

	abstract = {To make perceptual judgments, the brain must decode the responses of sensory cortical neurons. The direction of visual motion is represented by the activity of direction-selective neurons. Because these neurons are often broadly tuned and their responses are inherently variable, the brain must appropriately integrate their responses to infer the direction of motion reliably. The optimal integration strategy is task dependent. For coarse direction discriminations, neurons tuned to the directions of interest provide the most reliable information, but for fine discriminations, neurons with preferred directions displaced away from the target directions are more informative. We measured coarse and fine direction discriminations with random-dot stimuli. Unbeknownst to the observers, we added subthreshold motion signals of different directions to perturb the responses of different groups of direction-selective neurons. The pattern of biases induced by subthreshold signals of different directions indicates that subjects’ choice behavior relied on the activity of neurons with a wide range of preferred directions. For coarse discriminations, observers’ judgments were most strongly determined by neurons tuned to the target directions, but for fine discriminations, neurons with displaced preferred directions had the largest influence. We conclude that perceptual decisions rely on a population decoding strategy that takes the statistical reliability of sensory responses into account.},

But because these neurons show a bell-shaped tuning for direction, they have the highest signal-to-noise ratio for ‘discriminating’ the direction of motion when their preferred direction is off the direction to be discriminated. In this paper, we demonstrate with an adaptation paradigm that the visual system shows a corresponding task-speciﬁc ability to select neurons depending on whether it is performing a detection or a discrimination task, relying preferentially on different neuronal populations in the two tasks. Detection is based on neuronal populations tuned to the test direction, while direction discrimination is based on neurons preferring directions 40 – 60° off the test direction. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

More speciﬁcally, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal’s performance.

	abstract = {This study attempts to describe the notion of the ”self” using dynamical systems language based on the results of our robot learning experiments. A neural network model consisting of multiple modules is proposed, in which the interactive dynamics between the bottom-up perception and the top-down prediction are investigated. Our experiments with a real mobile robot showed that the incremental learning of the robot switches spontaneously between steady and unsteady phases. In the steady phase, the top-down prediction for the bottom-up perception works well when coherence is achieved between the internal and the environmental dynamics. In the unsteady phase, conﬂicts arise between the bottom-up perception and the top-down prediction; the coherence is lost, and a chaotic attractor is observed in the internal neural dynamics. By investigating possible analogies between this result and the phenomenological literature on the ”self”, we draw the conclusions that (1) the structure of the ”self” corresponds to the ”open dynamic structure” which is characterized by co-existence of stability in terms of goal-directedness and instability caused by embodiment; (2) the open dynamic structure causes the system’s spontaneous transition to the unsteady phase where the ”self” becomes aware.},

	abstract = {A biologically detailed computational model is described of how categorization judgments become automatic in tasks that depend on procedural learning. The model assumes 2 neural pathways from sensory association cortex to the premotor area that mediates response selection. A longer and slower path projects to the premotor area via the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. A faster, purely cortical path projects directly to the premotor area. The model assumes that the subcortical path has greater neural plasticity because of a dopamine-mediated learning signal from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the cortical-cortical path learns more slowly via (dopamine independent) Hebbian learning. Because of its greater plasticity, early performance is dominated by the subcortical path, but the development of automaticity is characterized by a transfer of control to the faster cortical-cortical projection. The model, called {SPEED} (Subcortical Pathways Enable Expertise Development), includes differential equations that describe activation in the relevant brain areas and difference equations that describe the 2- and 3-factor learning. A variety of simulations are described, showing that the model accounts for some classic single-cell recording and behavioral results.},

	abstract = {Theorists are converging from quite different quarters on a version of the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness, but there are residual confusions to be dissolved. In particular, theorists must resist the temptation to see global accessibility as the cause of consciousness (as if consciousness were some other, further condition); rather, it is consciousness. A useful metaphor for keeping this elusive idea in focus is that consciousness is rather like fame in the brain. It is not a privileged medium of representation, or an added property some states have; it is the very mutual accessibility that gives some informational states the powers that come with a subject's consciousness of that information. Like fame, consciousness is not a momentary condition, or a purely dispositional state, but rather a matter of actual in¯uence over time. Theorists who take on the task of accounting for the aftermath that is critical for consciousness often appear to be leaving out the Subject of consciousness, when in fact they are providing an analysis of the Subject, a necessary component in any serious theory of consciousness. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The interface in Python has been designed to be close to the {PyNN} interface, while the deﬁnition of neuron and synapse models can be speciﬁed using an equation-oriented mathematical description similar to the Brian neural simulator. This information is used to generate C++ code that will efﬁciently perform the simulation on the chosen parallel hardware (multi-core system or graphical processing unit). Several numerical methods are available to transform ordinary differential equations into an efﬁcient C++code. We compare the parallel performance of the simulator to existing solutions.},

	abstract = {We study dynamical mechanisms underlying oscillatory behavior in reciprocal inhibitory pairs of neurons, using a two-dimensional cell model. We introduce one-and-two dimensional phase portraits to illustrate the behaviors, thus reducing the study of dynamical mechanisms to planar geometrical properties. We examined whether other mechanisms besides the escape and release mechanisms (Wang and Rinzel, 1992) might be needed for some cases of reciprocal inhibition, and show that, within the conﬁnes of a simple two-dimensional cell model, escape and release are sufﬁcient for all cases. We divided the behaviors of a single cell into six different types and examined the joint behaviors arising from every combination of pairs of cells with behaviors drawn from these six types. For the case of two quiescent cells or two cells each having plateau potentials, bifurcation diagrams demonstrate the relations between synaptic threshold and synaptic strength necessary for oscillations by escape, oscillations by release, or network-generated plateau potentials. Thus we clarify the relationship between plateau potentials and oscillations in a cell. Using the two dimensional cell model we examine 1:N beating between cells and ﬁnd that our simple model displays many of the essential dynamical properties displayed by more sophisticated models, some of which relate to thalamocortical spindling.},

Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains. Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.},

We designed a systems-level computational model of motor learning, including a cortex-basal ganglia motor loop and the cerebellum that both determine the response of central pattern generators in the brainstem. First, we demonstrate its ability to learn arm movements toward different motor goals. Second, we test the model in a motor adaptation task with cognitive control, where the model replicates human data. We conclude that the cortex-basal ganglia loop learns via a novelty-based motor prediction error to determine concrete actions given a desired outcome, and that the cerebellum minimizes the remaining aiming error.},

	abstract = {Animal learning is associated with changes in the efficacy of connections between neurons. The rules that govern this plasticity can be tested in neural networks. Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning ({AGREL}). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. {AGREL} is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

	abstract = {Theories and models of the basal ganglia have mainly focused on the role of three different corticothalamic pathways: direct, indirect and hyperdirect. Although the indirect and the hyperdirect pathways are linked through the bidirectional connections between the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and the external globus pallidus ({GPe}), the role of their interactions has been mainly discussed in the context of a dysfunction (abnormal oscillations in Parkinson’s disease) and not of its function. We here propose a novel role for the loop formed by the {STN} and the {GPe}. We show, through a neuro-computational model, that this loop can bias the selection of actions during the exploratory period after a change in the environmental conditions towards alternative responses. Testing well-known alternative solutions before completely random actions can reduce the time required for the search of a new response after a rule change. Our simulations further show that the knowledge acquired by the indirect pathway can be transferred into a stable memory via learning in the hyperdirect pathway to establish the blocking of unwanted responses. After a rule switch, ﬁrst the indirect pathway learns to inhibit the previously correct actions. Once the new correct association is learned, the inhibition is transferred to the hyperdirect pathway through synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {In visual search for pop-out targets, search times are shorter when the target and nontarget colors from the previous trial are repeated than when they change. This priming effect was originally attributed to a feature weighting mechanism that biases attention toward the target features, and away from the non-target features. However, more recent studies have shown that visual selection is strongly context-dependent: according to a relational account of feature priming, the target color is always encoded relative to the non-target color (e.g., as redder or greener). The present study provides a critical test of this hypothesis, by varying the colors of the search items such that either the relative color or the absolute color of the target always remained constant (or both). The results clearly show that color priming depends on the relative color of a target with respect to the nontargets but not on its absolute color value. Moreover, the observed priming effects did not change over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the visual system encodes colors in a relative manner from the start of the experiment. Taken together, these results strongly support a relational account of feature priming in visual search, and are inconsistent with the dominant feature-based views.},

	abstract = {One of the most widespread views in vision research is that top-down control over visual selection is achieved by tuning attention to a particular feature value (e.g., red/yellow). Contrary to this view, previous spatial cueing studies showed that attention can be tuned to relative features of a search target (e.g., redder): An irrelevant distractor (cue) captured attention when it had the same relative color as the target (e.g., redder), and failed to capture when it had a different relative color, regardless of whether the distractor was similar or dissimilar to the target. The present study tested whether the same effects would be observed for eye movements when observers have to search for a color or shape target and when selection errors were very noticeable (resulting in an erroneous eye movement to the distractor). The results corroborated the previous findings, showing that capture by an irrelevant distractor does not depend on the distractor’s similarity to the target but on whether it matches or mismatches the relative attributes of the search target. Extending on previous work, we also found that participants can be pretrained to select a color target in virtue of its exact feature value. Contrary to the prevalent feature-based view, the results suggest that visual selection is preferentially biased toward the relative attributes of a search target. Simultaneously, however, visual selection can be biased to specific color values when the task requires it, which rules out a purely relational account of attention and eye movements.},

Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More speciﬁcally, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal’s performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

	abstract = {Large islands of extrastriate cortex that are enriched for color-tuned neurons have recently been described in alert macaque using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and single-unit recording. These millimeter-sized islands, dubbed “globs,” are scattered throughout the posterior inferior temporal cortex ({PIT}), a swath of brain anterior to area V3, including areas V4, {PITd}, and posterior {TEO}. We investigated the micro-organization of neurons within the globs. We used {fMRI} to identify the globs and then used {MRI}-guided microelectrodes to test the color properties of single glob cells. We used color stimuli that sample the {CIELUV} perceptual color space at regular intervals to test the color tuning of single units, and make two observations. First, color-tuned neurons of various color preferences were found within single globs. Second, adjacent glob cells tended to have the same color tuning, demonstrating that glob cells are clustered by color preference and suggesting that they are arranged in color columns. Neurons separated by 50 μm, measured parallel to the cortical sheet, had more similar color tuning than neurons separated by 100 μm, suggesting that the scale of the color columns is {\textless}100 μm. These results show that color-tuned neurons in {PIT} are organized by color preference on a finer scale than the scale of single globs. Moreover, the color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along a given electrode penetration shifted gradually in many penetrations, suggesting that the color columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map reflecting perceptual color space.},

For example, when searching for an apple, a person might hold its color (red) and shape (round) in memory while looking for it. It is frequently assumed that visual search is most efficient when one holds veridical features that perfectly match the target. However, this is not always true when the distractor context is predictable. Our work demonstrates that expectations about the distractor features and similarity to the target can cause the remembered features of the target to be exaggerated away. The results suggest that visual search is most efficient when one searches for target characteristics that are more distinct from visual distractors.},

	abstract = {We will describe a computational model of attention which explains the guidance of spatial attention by feedback within a distributed network. We hypothesize that feedback within the ventral pathway transfers the target template from prefrontal areas into intermediate areas like V4. The oculomotor circuit consisting of {FEF}, {LIP} and superior colliculus picks up this distributed activity and provides a continuous spatial reentry signal from premotor cells. In order to test this hypothesis, we simulate two experiments that require a response given a color cue. The ﬁrst experiment indicates a parallel feature-based enhancement prior to any spatial selection. If two targets are behaviorally relevant, as in the second experiment, experimental ﬁndings indicate that subjects split their attention between two locations containing the searched feature. Our simulation results suggest that the split in attention between two foci is a transient eﬀect occurring during competition. We predict that the time after cue presentation determines the state of this competition and ultimately the distribution of attention at diﬀerent locations. In addition we provide simulation results to explain how reentrant processing through the oculomotor circuit might lead to variations of the time for target detection in visual search.},

But because these neurons show a bell-shaped tuning for direction, they have the highest signal-to-noise ratio for ‘discriminating’ the direction of motion when their preferred direction is off the direction to be discriminated. In this paper, we demonstrate with an adaptation paradigm that the visual system shows a corresponding task-speciﬁc ability to select neurons depending on whether it is performing a detection or a discrimination task, relying preferentially on different neuronal populations in the two tasks. Detection is based on neuronal populations tuned to the test direction, while direction discrimination is based on neurons preferring directions 40 – 60° off the test direction. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, unlike laboratory participants, searchers in the real world rarely have perfect knowledge regarding the potential appearance of targets. In seven experiments, we examined how the precision of target templates affects the ability to conduct visual search. Specifically, we degraded template precision in two ways: 1) by contaminating searchers’ templates with inaccurate features, and 2) by introducing extraneous features to the template that were unhelpful. We recorded eye movements to allow inferences regarding the relative extents to which attentional guidance and decision-making are hindered by template imprecision. Our findings support a dual-function theory of the target template and highlight the importance of examining template precision in visual search.},

To understand how feature attention is used to find and select objects for action, we focused on the ventral pre-arcuate ({VPA}) region of prefrontal cortex. In a visual search task, {VPA} cells responded selectively to search cues, maintained their feature selectivity throughout the delay and subsequent saccades, and discriminated the search target in their receptive fields with a timecourse earlier than in {FEF} or {IT} cortex. Inactivation of {VPA} impaired the animals’ ability to find targets, and simultaneous recordings in {FEF} revealed that the effects of feature attention were eliminated while leaving the effects of spatial attention in {FEF} intact. Altogether, the results suggest that {VPA} neurons compute the locations of objects with the features sought and send this information to {FEF} to guide eye movements to those relevant stimuli.},

	abstract = {To make perceptual judgments, the brain must decode the responses of sensory cortical neurons. The direction of visual motion is represented by the activity of direction-selective neurons. Because these neurons are often broadly tuned and their responses are inherently variable, the brain must appropriately integrate their responses to infer the direction of motion reliably. The optimal integration strategy is task dependent. For coarse direction discriminations, neurons tuned to the directions of interest provide the most reliable information, but for fine discriminations, neurons with preferred directions displaced away from the target directions are more informative. We measured coarse and fine direction discriminations with random-dot stimuli. Unbeknownst to the observers, we added subthreshold motion signals of different directions to perturb the responses of different groups of direction-selective neurons. The pattern of biases induced by subthreshold signals of different directions indicates that subjects’ choice behavior relied on the activity of neurons with a wide range of preferred directions. For coarse discriminations, observers’ judgments were most strongly determined by neurons tuned to the target directions, but for fine discriminations, neurons with displaced preferred directions had the largest influence. We conclude that perceptual decisions rely on a population decoding strategy that takes the statistical reliability of sensory responses into account.},

To measure the precision of attentional selection, we used a cue-target paradigm where participants searched for a colored target. Typically, {RTs} are shorter at the cued compared to uncued locations when the cue has the same color as the target. In contrast, cueing effects are absent or even inverted when cue and target colors are dissimilar. By systematically varying the difference between cue and target color, we calculated a function relating cue color to cueing effects. The width of this function reflects the precision of attentional selection and was compared to the precision of judgments of the target color on a color wheel. The precision of the memory representation was far better than the precision of attentional selection. When the task was made more difficult by increasing the similarity between the target and the nontarget stimuli in the target display, the precision of attentional selection increased, but was still worse than the precision of memory. When the search task was made more difficult, we also observed that for dissimilar cue colors, {RTs} were slower at cued than at uncued locations (i.e., same location costs), suggesting that improvements in attentional selectivity were achieved by suppressing non-target colors.},

Acting as a ﬁlter on perceptual representations, {VSA} allows preferential processing of relevant objects and concurrently inhibits traces of irrelevant items, thus preventing harmful distraction. Recent evidence showed that monetary rewards for performance on {VSA} tasks strongly affect immediately subsequent deployment of attention; a typical aftereffect of {VSA} (negative priming) was found only following highly rewarded selections. Here we report a much more striking demonstration that the controlled delivery of monetary rewards also affects attentional processing several days later.

	abstract = {A common theory is that when looking for a known target, the visual attention is directed to the features of the target, thus enhancing the response to the target in the visual system. In a study by Navalpakkam \& Itti (2007) it was shown that subjects in a visual search task, in which the target was very similar to the distractors, did not learn to direct the attention directly to the features of the target, as this would also enhance the response to the distractors. In this work, the visual search task of Navalpakkam \& Itti (2007) was performed with a biologically plausible neural model. For this a model of the visual system (Beuth, 2017) was combined with a model of the basal ganglia (Villagrasa, Baladron, \& Hamker, 2016). In this combined model, the basal ganglia receive information about the visual input through the inferior temporal cortex ({IT}) and control the activity of the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}). Activity in the {PFC} causes feature-based attention in the visual model. The combined model can select certain items of the visual input through feature-based and spatial attention and learns to direct the feature-based attention to certain features due to reward. The findings of Navalpakkam \& Itti (2007) could be replicated with the model. The model thus demonstrates a very interesting, so far poorly investigated function of the basal ganglia, which could also explain other findings about the effects of reward on attention.},

We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features.

Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that the tail of the caudate nucleus and extrastriate visual cortex respond preferentially to task-irrelevant but previously reward-associated objects, providing an attentional priority signal that is sensitive to reward history. The caudate tail has not been implicated in the control of goal-directed or stimulus-driven attention, but is well suited to mediate the value-driven control of attention.

Extensive evidence now indicates a role for the basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, in learning and memory. One prominent hypothesis is that this brain region mediates a form of learning in which stimulus-response (S-R) associations or habits are incrementally acquired. Support for this hypothesis is provided by numerous neurobehavioral studies in different mammalian species, including rats, monkeys, and humans. In rats and monkeys, localized brain lesion and pharmacological approaches have been used to examine the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning. In humans, study of patients with neurodegenerative diseases that compromise the basal ganglia, as well as research using brain neuroimaging techniques, also provide evidence of a role for the basal ganglia in habit learning. Several of these studies have dissociated the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning from those of a cognitive or declarative medial temporal lobe memory system that includes the hippocampus as a primary component. Evidence suggests that during learning, basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe memory systems are activated simultaneously and that in some learning situations competitive interference exists between these two systems.},

Whereas, numerous studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of visual attention at the single neuron and population level in the visual cortices, considerably less work has been devoted to deciphering the distinct contribution of higher-order brain areas, which are known to be critical for the employment of attention. Among these areas, the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) has long been considered a source of top-down signals that bias selection in early visual areas in favor of the attended features. Here, we review recent experimental data that support the role of {PFC} in attention.

Wolfe and Van Wert (2010) propose 2 causes of this effect: reducing the quitting threshold, and conservatively shifting the decision making criterion used to evaluate each item. Reducing the quitting threshold predicts that target absent responses will be made without fully inspecting the display, increasing misses due to never inspecting the target (selection errors). The shift in decision criterion increases the likelihood of failing to recognize an inspected target (identification errors). Though there is robust evidence that target prevalence rates shift quitting thresholds, the proposed shift in decision making criterion has little support. In Experiment 1 we eye-tracked participants during searches of high, medium, and low prevalence. Eye movements were used to classify misses as selection or identification errors. Identification errors increased as prevalence decreased, supporting the claim that decision criterion becomes more conservative as prevalence decreases. In addition, as prevalence decreased, the dwell time on targets increased while dwell times on distractors decreased. We propose that the effect of prevalence on decision making for individual items is best modeled as a shift in criterion in a drift diffusion model, rather than signal detection, as drift diffusion accounts for this pattern of decision times. In Experiment 2 we replicate these findings while presenting stimuli in an rapid serial visual presentation ({RSVP}) stream. Experiments 1 and 2 were consistent with the conclusion that prevalence rate influences the item-by-item decision criterion, and are consistent with a drift diffusion model of this decision process.},

Via reinforcement learning in basal ganglia, the model develops flexible control of working memory within prefrontal loops and achieves selection of appropriate responses based on working memory content and visual stimulation within a motor loop. We show that both working memory control and response selection can evolve within parallel and interacting cortico-basalganglio-thalamic loops by Hebbian and three-factor learning rules. Furthermore, the model gives a coherent explanation for how complex strategies of working memory control and response selection can derive from basic cognitive operations that can be learned via trial and error.},

	abstract = {In Parkinson’s disease, a loss of dopamine neurons causes severe motor impairments. These motor impairments have long been thought to result exclusively from immediate effects of dopamine loss on neuronal ﬁring in basal ganglia, causing imbalances of basal ganglia pathways. However, motor impairments and pathway imbalances may also result from dysfunctional synaptic plasticity – a novel concept of how Parkinsonian symptoms evolve. Here we built a neuro-computational model that allows us to simulate the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity in basal ganglia. Our simulations conﬁrm that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity can indeed explain the emergence of both motor impairments and pathway imbalances in Parkinson’s disease, thus corroborating the novel concept. By predicting that dysfunctional plasticity results not only in reduced activation of desired responses, but also in their active inhibition, our simulations provide novel testable predictions. When simulating dopamine replacement therapy (which is a standard treatment in clinical practice), we observe a new balance of pathway outputs, rather than a simple restoration of non-Parkinsonian states. In addition, high doses of replacement are shown to result in overshooting motor activity, in line with empirical evidence. Finally, our simulations provide an explanation for the intensely debated paradox that focused basal ganglia lesions alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, but do not impair performance in healthy animals. Overall, our simulations suggest that the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity play an essential role in the development of Parkinsonian symptoms, thus arguing for a re-conceptualisation of Parkinsonian pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Humans are adept at distinguishing between stimuli that are very similar, an ability that is particularly crucial when the outcome is of serious consequence (e.g., for a surgeon or air-traffic controller). Traditionally, selective attention was thought to facilitate perception by increasing the gain of sensory neurons tuned to the defining features of a behaviorally relevant object (e.g., color, orientation, etc.). In contrast, recent mathematical models counterintuitively suggest that, in many cases, attentional gain should be applied to neurons that are tuned away from relevant features, especially when discriminating highly similar stimuli. Here we used psychophysical methods to critically evaluate these “ideal observer” models. The data demonstrate that attention enhances the gain of the most informative sensory neurons, even when these neurons are tuned away from the behaviorally relevant target feature. Moreover, the degree to which an individual adopted optimal attentional gain settings by the end of testing predicted success rates on a difficult visual discrimination task, as well as the amount of task improvement that occurred across repeated testing sessions (learning). Contrary to most traditional accounts, these observations suggest that the primary function of attentional gain is not to enhance the representation of target features per se, but instead to optimize performance on the current perceptual task. Additionally, individual differences in gain suggest that the operating characteristics of low-level attentional phenomena are not stable trait-like attributes and that variability in how attention is deployed may play an important role in determining perceptual abilities.},

However, when performing a difficult discrimination between two highly similar stimuli, perceptual decisions should instead be based on the activity of neurons tuned away from the relevant feature ( off-channel neurons) as these neurons undergo a larger firing rate change and are thus more informative. To test this hypothesis, we measured feature-selective responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) using functional magnetic resonance imaging and show that the degree of off-channel activation predicts performance on a difficult visual discrimination task. Moreover, this predictive relationship between off-channel activation and perceptual acuity is not simply the result of extensive practice with a specific stimulus feature (as in studies of perceptual learning). Instead, relying on the output of the most informative sensory neurons may represent a general, and optimal, strategy for efficiently computing perceptual decisions.},

The second aspect of categorization discussed is the selection of appropriate actions or behaviors on the basis of category membership, and the role of the visual corticostriatal loop output and the motor corticostriatal loop, which connects motor planning areas with the putamen, in action selection. The third aspect of categorization discussed is how categories are learned with the aid of feedback linked dopaminergic projections to the basal ganglia.

	abstract = {Background: Attending to the spatial location or to nonspatial features of visual stimuli can modulate neuronal responses in primate visual cortex. The modulation by spatial attention changes the gain of sensory neurons and strengthens the representation of attended locations without changing neuronal selectivities such as directionality, i.e., the ratio of responses to preferred and anti-preferred directions of motion. Whether feature-based attention acts in a similar manner is unknown.
Results: To clarify this issue, we recorded the responses of 135 direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal area ({MT}) of two macaques to an unattended moving random dot pattern (the distractor) positioned inside a neuron’s receptive field while the animals attended to a second moving pattern positioned in the opposite hemifield. Responses to different directions of the distractor were modulated by the same factor (approximately 12\%) as long as the attended direction remained unchanged. On the other hand, systematically changing the attended direction from a neuron’s preferred to its anti-preferred direction caused a systematic change of the attentional modulation from an enhancement to a suppression, increasing directionality by about 20\%.
Conclusions: The results show that (1) feature-based attention exerts a multiplicative modulation upon neuronal responses and that the strength of this modulation depends on the similarity between the attended feature and the cell’s preferred feature, in line with the featuresimilarity gain model, and (2) at the level of the neuronal population, feature-based attention increases the selectivity for attended features by increasing the responses of neurons preferring this feature value while decreasing responses of neurons tuned to the opposite feature value.},

Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that the tail of the caudate nucleus and extrastriate visual cortex respond preferentially to task-irrelevant but previously reward-associated objects, providing an attentional priority signal that is sensitive to reward history. The caudate tail has not been implicated in the control of goal-directed or stimulus-driven attention, but is well suited to mediate the value-driven control of attention.

	abstract = {In addition to the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}), the basal ganglia ({BG}) have been increasingly often reported to play a fundamental role in category learning, but the circuit mechanisms mediating their interaction remain to be explored. We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the {BG}–{PFC} interplay. We propose that the {BG} bias {PFC} activity by removing the inhibition of cortico–thalamo–cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the {PFC}. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model's predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the {BG} with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico–{BG}–cortical loops.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Inspired by the idea that basal ganglia ({BG}) teach the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) to acquire category representations, we developed a novel neurocomputational model and tested it on a task that was recently applied in monkey experiments. As an advantage over previous models of category learning, our model allows to compare simulation data with single-cell recordings in {PFC} and {BG}. We not only derived model predictions, but already verified a prediction to explain the observed drop in striatal category selectivity. When testing our model with a simple, real-world face categorization task, we observed that the fast striatal learning with a performance of 85\% correct responses can teach the slower {PFC} learning to push the model performance up to almost 100\%.},

For example, an action followed by reward will be more readily elicited on subsequent encounters with the same stimuli and context—a phenomenon known as the law of effect. These consequences of rewards (and punishments) are important because they reinforce adaptive behaviors at the expense of competing ones, thus increasing ﬁtness of the organism in its environment. However, it is unknown whether similar inﬂuences regulate covert mental processes, such as visual selective attention. Visual selective attention allows privileged processing of task-relevant information, while inhibiting distracting contextual elements. Using variable monetary rewards as arbitrary feedback on performance, we tested whether acts of attentional selection, and in particular the resulting aftereffects, can be modulated by their consequences. Results show that the efﬁcacy of visual selective attention can be sensibly adjusted by external feedback. Specifically, although lingering inhibition of distractors is robust after highly rewarded selections, it is eliminated after poorly rewarded selections. This powerful feature of visual selective attention provides attentive processes with both ﬂexibility and self-regulation properties.},

	abstract = {Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were recorded during visual discrimination tasks in which stimulus arrays were presented that contained one lateral target and 3 (experiment 1) or one (experiments 2 and 3) non-targets. In experiments 1 and 2, targets differed from non-targets with respect to their form or their color. In experiment 3, word pairs were presented, with targets differing from nontargets with respect to their content. Subjects were required to respond to the identity of the target. In all experiments, an enhanced negativity was elicited at posterior electrodes contralateral to the location of the target. In the form discrimination tasks, this effect was present in the Nl, N2, and P3 time intervals. In the color discrimination tasks, it was confined to the N2 time range. In the word discrimination task (experiment 3), this effect could only be observed over the left posterior hemisphere. It is argued that these lateralized negativities reflect the N2pc component that is assumed to indicate attentional filtering processes during visual search tasks. The present results extend this assumption by showing that this component is also elicited when targets are presented together with just one non-target Item. It is argued that the N2pc may reflect the attentional selection of task-relevant stimuli.},

	abstract = {Recent research has suggested that inhibition of return ({IOR}) develops more quickly when subjects must respond with an eye movement than when they make a manual response to the target (Perception and Psychophysics 62 (2000) 1512–1524). Four spatial cueing experiments were conducted where subjects had to indicate the location of visual targets. Within each of the oculomotor and manual modalities, responses could be either directed towards the target (saccade or pointing) or had a more complex stimulus–response (S–R) mapping. For both saccadic and manual responses, {IOR} onset was delayed as the required S–R mapping became more indirect. This ﬁnding further emphasizes the role of response-related processes in spatial attention. Possible explanations for this pattern of results are considered, including the notion that activity in prefrontal cortex, needed for execution of such abstract S–R mappings, may inﬂuence the time course of reﬂexive spatial cueing eﬀects.},

The time course of this similarity effect was investigated by varying target contrast and analyzing {SRT} distributions. With foveal distractors, the similarity effect increased with increasing {SRT}, suggesting that top-down enhancement of target features increased over time. This allowed for successful saccades to the peripheral target, but also entailed larger distraction by target-similar stimuli. Similarity effects with peripheral distractors did not increase with {SRT}, which we attribute to location-based inhibition containing the growing enhancement of target features. Strong inhibition was likely with peripheral distractors because they always appeared at the same task-irrelevant location. Prior inhibition with foveal distractors was weaker because this would have partially released fixation and entailed anticipations.},

Search arrays were preceded by spatially nonpredictive color singleton cues. Behavioral spatial cueing effects indicative of attentional capture were elicited only by targetmatching but not by distractor-color cues. However, when search displays contained 1 target-color and 1 distractor-color object among gray nontargets, N2pc components were triggered not only by targetcolor but also by distractor-color cues both in the one-color and two-color task, demonstrating that task-set nonmatching items attracted attention. When search displays contained 6 items in 6 different colors, so that participants had to adopt a fully feature-specific task set, the N2pc to distractor-color cues was eliminated in both tasks, indicating that nonmatching items were now successfully excluded from attentional processing. These results demonstrate that when observers adopt a feature-specific search mode, attentional task sets can be configured flexibly for multiple features within the same dimension, resulting in the rapid allocation of attention to task-set matching objects only.},

	abstract = {The probability of missing a target increases in low target prevalence search tasks. Wolfe and Van Wert (2010) propose 2 causes of this effect: reducing the quitting threshold, and conservatively shifting the decision making criterion used to evaluate each item. Reducing the quitting threshold predicts that target absent responses will be made without fully inspecting the display, increasing misses due to never inspecting the target (selection errors). The shift in decision criterion increases the likelihood of failing to recognize an inspected target (identification errors). Though there is robust evidence that target prevalence rates shift quitting thresholds, the proposed shift in decision making criterion has little support. In Experiment 1 we eye-tracked participants during searches of high, medium, and low prevalence. Eye movements were used to classify misses as selection or identification errors. Identification errors increased as prevalence decreased, supporting the claim that decision criterion becomes more conservative as prevalence decreases. In addition, as prevalence decreased, the dwell time on targets increased while dwell times on distractors decreased. We propose that the effect of prevalence on decision making for individual items is best modeled as a shift in criterion in a drift diffusion model, rather than signal detection, as drift diffusion accounts for this pattern of decision times. In Experiment 2 we replicate these findings while presenting stimuli in an rapid serial visual presentation ({RSVP}) stream. Experiments 1 and 2 were consistent with the conclusion that prevalence rate influences the item-by-item decision criterion, and are consistent with a drift diffusion model of this decision process.},

In this example, how does attending to the red scarf (a distractor) affect your ability to later find your jacket (the target)? One hypothesis is that processing at the location of the scarf will temporarily remain enhanced, but recent electrophysiological evidence suggests that processing at that location is rapidly suppressed. Here, we show that reflexively orienting attention to a distractor boosts perceptual processing of subsequent items at that location and that an electrophysiological component thought to reflect distractor suppression reflects instead the enhancement of a subsequent item appearing at the same location. Enhancing the perceptual representation of an irrelevant object impairs search for the target, while enhancing the perceptual representation of the target itself facilitates search.},

Striatal projection neurons were identified by antidromic activation and fast-spiking {GABAergic} interneurons ({FSIs}) by their unique characteristics: briefer spike and burst responses. Juxtacellular injection of neurobiotin combined with parvalbumin immunohistochemistry validated this identification. Spontaneous activities and spike responses to cortical stimulation were recorded during both states of cortical activity: slow waves and desynchronization. Both {FSI} and projection neurons spontaneously discharged synchronously with slow waves at the maximum of cortical activity, but, on average, {FSIs} were much more active. Cortical desynchronization enhanced {FSI} activity and facilitated their spike responses to cortical stimulation, whereas opposite effects were observed regarding projection neurons. Experimental conditions favoring {FSI} discharge were always associated with a decrease in the firing activity of projection neurons. Spike responses to cortical stimulation occurred earlier (latency difference, 4.6 ms) and with a lower stimulation current for {FSIs} than for projection neurons. Moreover, blocking {GABA}
              A
              receptors by local picrotoxin injection enhanced the spike response of projection neurons, and this increase was larger in experimental conditions favoring {FSI} responses. Therefore, on average, {FSIs} exert
              in vivo
              a powerful feedforward inhibition on projection neurons. However, a few projection neurons were actually more sensitive to cortical stimulation than {FSIs}. Moreover, picrotoxin, which revealed {FSI} inhibition, preferentially affected projection neurons exhibiting the weakest sensitivity to cortical stimulation. Thus, feedforward inhibition by {FSIs} filters cortical information effectively transmitted by striatal projection neurons.},

Models of Parkinson's disease propose that dopaminergic degeneration imbalances both pathways, although direct electrophysiological evidence is lacking. Here, striatal neurons were identified by electrophysiological criteria and Neurobiotin labeling combined with either immunohistochemistry or
              in situ
              hybridization. Their spontaneous discharge activity and spike response to cortical stimulation were recorded
              in vivo
              in anesthetized rats rendered hemi-parkinsonian by 6-hydroxydopamine. We showed that striatonigral neurons (direct pathway) were inhibited whereas striatopallidal neurons (indirect pathway) were activated by dopaminergic lesion. We also identified, with antidromic stimulations, corticostriatal neurons that preferentially innervate striatonigral or striatopallidal neurons and showed that dopaminergic depletion selectively decreased the spontaneous activity of the former. Therefore, dopamine degeneration induces a cascade of imbalances that spread out of the basal ganglia and affect the whole basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits.
            
            Fast-spiking {GABA} interneurons provide potent feedforward inhibition of striatal projection neurons. We showed here that these interneurons narrowed the time window of the responses of projection neurons to cortical stimulation. In the dopamine-depleted striatum, because the intrinsic activity of these interneurons was not altered, their feedforward inhibition worsened the striatal imbalance. Indeed, the time window of the evoked responses was narrower for striatonigral neurons and wider for striatopallidal neurons. Therefore, after dopaminergic depletion, cortical inputs and {GABA} interneurons might imbalance striatal projection neurons and represent two novel nondopaminergic mechanisms that might secondarily contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.},

Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning ({AGREL}). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. {AGREL} is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

We introduce here a set of four key concepts, integrated and evaluated by means of a neuro-computational model, that bring together current ideas regarding cortex–basal ganglia interactions in the context of habit learning. According to key concept 1, each loop learns to select an intermediate objective at a different abstraction level, moving from goals in the ventral striatum to motor in the putamen. Key concept 2 proposes that the cortex integrates the basal ganglia selection with environmental information regarding the achieved objective. Key concept 3 claims shortcuts between loops, and key concept 4 predicts that loops compute their own prediction error signal for learning. Computational benefits of the key concepts are demonstrated. Contrasting with former concepts of habit learning, the loops collaborate to select goal-directed actions while training slower shortcuts develops habitual responses.},

	abstract = {Theories and models of the basal ganglia have mainly focused on the role of three different corticothalamic pathways: direct, indirect and hyperdirect. Although the indirect and the hyperdirect pathways are linked through the bidirectional connections between the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and the external globus pallidus ({GPe}), the role of their interactions has been mainly discussed in the context of a dysfunction (abnormal oscillations in Parkinson’s disease) and not of its function. We here propose a novel role for the loop formed by the {STN} and the {GPe}. We show, through a neuro-computational model, that this loop can bias the selection of actions during the exploratory period after a change in the environmental conditions towards alternative responses. Testing well-known alternative solutions before completely random actions can reduce the time required for the search of a new response after a rule change. Our simulations further show that the knowledge acquired by the indirect pathway can be transferred into a stable memory via learning in the hyperdirect pathway to establish the blocking of unwanted responses. After a rule switch, ﬁrst the indirect pathway learns to inhibit the previously correct actions. Once the new correct association is learned, the inhibition is transferred to the hyperdirect pathway through synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {In visual search for pop-out targets, search times are shorter when the target and nontarget colors from the previous trial are repeated than when they change. This priming effect was originally attributed to a feature weighting mechanism that biases attention toward the target features, and away from the non-target features. However, more recent studies have shown that visual selection is strongly context-dependent: according to a relational account of feature priming, the target color is always encoded relative to the non-target color (e.g., as redder or greener). The present study provides a critical test of this hypothesis, by varying the colors of the search items such that either the relative color or the absolute color of the target always remained constant (or both). The results clearly show that color priming depends on the relative color of a target with respect to the nontargets but not on its absolute color value. Moreover, the observed priming effects did not change over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the visual system encodes colors in a relative manner from the start of the experiment. Taken together, these results strongly support a relational account of feature priming in visual search, and are inconsistent with the dominant feature-based views.},

	abstract = {One of the most widespread views in vision research is that top-down control over visual selection is achieved by tuning attention to a particular feature value (e.g., red/yellow). Contrary to this view, previous spatial cueing studies showed that attention can be tuned to relative features of a search target (e.g., redder): An irrelevant distractor (cue) captured attention when it had the same relative color as the target (e.g., redder), and failed to capture when it had a different relative color, regardless of whether the distractor was similar or dissimilar to the target. The present study tested whether the same effects would be observed for eye movements when observers have to search for a color or shape target and when selection errors were very noticeable (resulting in an erroneous eye movement to the distractor). The results corroborated the previous findings, showing that capture by an irrelevant distractor does not depend on the distractor’s similarity to the target but on whether it matches or mismatches the relative attributes of the search target. Extending on previous work, we also found that participants can be pretrained to select a color target in virtue of its exact feature value. Contrary to the prevalent feature-based view, the results suggest that visual selection is preferentially biased toward the relative attributes of a search target. Simultaneously, however, visual selection can be biased to specific color values when the task requires it, which rules out a purely relational account of attention and eye movements.},

More speciﬁcally, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal’s performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

How is this representation transformed to bring about color perception? Prior work implicates populations of glob cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex ({PIT}; the V4 complex), but the correspondence between the neural representation of color in {PIT}/V4 complex and the organization of perceptual color space is unclear. We compared color-tuning data for populations of glob cells and interglob cells to predictions obtained using models that varied in the color-tuning narrowness of the cells, and the color preference distribution across the populations. Glob cells were best accounted for by simulated neurons that have nonlinear (narrow) tuning and, as a population, represent a color space designed to be perceptually uniform ({CIELUV}). Multidimensional scaling and representational similarity analyses showed that the color space representations in both glob and interglob populations were correlated with the organization of {CIELUV} space, but glob cells showed a stronger correlation. Hue could be classified invariant to luminance with high accuracy given glob responses and above-chance accuracy given interglob responses. Luminance could be read out invariant to changes in hue in both populations, but interglob cells tended to prefer stimuli having luminance contrast, regardless of hue, whereas glob cells typically retained hue tuning as luminance contrast was modulated. The combined luminance/hue sensitivity of glob cells is predicted for neurons that can distinguish two colors of the same hue at different luminance levels (orange/brown).},

These millimeter-sized islands, dubbed “globs,” are scattered throughout the posterior inferior temporal cortex ({PIT}), a swath of brain anterior to area V3, including areas V4, {PITd}, and posterior {TEO}. We investigated the micro-organization of neurons within the globs. We used {fMRI} to identify the globs and then used {MRI}-guided microelectrodes to test the color properties of single glob cells. We used color stimuli that sample the {CIELUV} perceptual color space at regular intervals to test the color tuning of single units, and make two observations. First, color-tuned neurons of various color preferences were found within single globs. Second, adjacent glob cells tended to have the same color tuning, demonstrating that glob cells are clustered by color preference and suggesting that they are arranged in color columns. Neurons separated by 50 μm, measured parallel to the cortical sheet, had more similar color tuning than neurons separated by 100 μm, suggesting that the scale of the color columns is {\textless}100 μm. These results show that color-tuned neurons in {PIT} are organized by color preference on a finer scale than the scale of single globs. Moreover, the color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along a given electrode penetration shifted gradually in many penetrations, suggesting that the color columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map reflecting perceptual color space.},

	abstract = {Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were recorded during visual discrimination tasks in which stimulus arrays were presented that contained one lateral target and 3 (experiment 1) or one (experiments 2 and 3) non-targets. In experiments 1 and 2, targets differed from non-targets with respect to their form or their color. In experiment 3, word pairs were presented, with targets differing from nontargets with respect to their content. Subjects were required to respond to the identity of the target. In all experiments, an enhanced negativity was elicited at posterior electrodes contralateral to the location of the target. In the form discrimination tasks, this effect was present in the Nl, N2, and P3 time intervals. In the color discrimination tasks, it was confined to the N2 time range. In the word discrimination task (experiment 3), this effect could only be observed over the left posterior hemisphere. It is argued that these lateralized negativities reflect the N2pc component that is assumed to indicate attentional filtering processes during visual search tasks. The present results extend this assumption by showing that this component is also elicited when targets are presented together with just one non-target Item. It is argued that the N2pc may reflect the attentional selection of task-relevant stimuli.},

Within each of the oculomotor and manual modalities, responses could be either directed towards the target (saccade or pointing) or had a more complex stimulus–response (S–R) mapping. For both saccadic and manual responses, {IOR} onset was delayed as the required S–R mapping became more indirect. This ﬁnding further emphasizes the role of response-related processes in spatial attention.

The time course of this similarity effect was investigated by varying target contrast and analyzing {SRT} distributions. With foveal distractors, the similarity effect increased with increasing {SRT}, suggesting that top-down enhancement of target features increased over time. This allowed for successful saccades to the peripheral target, but also entailed larger distraction by target-similar stimuli. Similarity effects with peripheral distractors did not increase with {SRT}, which we attribute to location-based inhibition containing the growing enhancement of target features. Strong inhibition was likely with peripheral distractors because they always appeared at the same task-irrelevant location. Prior inhibition with foveal distractors was weaker because this would have partially released fixation and entailed anticipations.},

Search arrays were preceded by spatially nonpredictive color singleton cues. Behavioral spatial cueing effects indicative of attentional capture were elicited only by targetmatching but not by distractor-color cues. However, when search displays contained 1 target-color and 1 distractor-color object among gray nontargets, N2pc components were triggered not only by targetcolor but also by distractor-color cues both in the one-color and two-color task, demonstrating that task-set nonmatching items attracted attention. When search displays contained 6 items in 6 different colors, so that participants had to adopt a fully feature-specific task set, the N2pc to distractor-color cues was eliminated in both tasks, indicating that nonmatching items were now successfully excluded from attentional processing. These results demonstrate that when observers adopt a feature-specific search mode, attentional task sets can be configured flexibly for multiple features within the same dimension, resulting in the rapid allocation of attention to task-set matching objects only.},

	abstract = {The probability of missing a target increases in low target prevalence search tasks. Wolfe and Van Wert (2010) propose 2 causes of this effect: reducing the quitting threshold, and conservatively shifting the decision making criterion used to evaluate each item. Reducing the quitting threshold predicts that target absent responses will be made without fully inspecting the display, increasing misses due to never inspecting the target (selection errors). The shift in decision criterion increases the likelihood of failing to recognize an inspected target (identification errors). Though there is robust evidence that target prevalence rates shift quitting thresholds, the proposed shift in decision making criterion has little support. In Experiment 1 we eye-tracked participants during searches of high, medium, and low prevalence. Eye movements were used to classify misses as selection or identification errors. Identification errors increased as prevalence decreased, supporting the claim that decision criterion becomes more conservative as prevalence decreases. In addition, as prevalence decreased, the dwell time on targets increased while dwell times on distractors decreased. We propose that the effect of prevalence on decision making for individual items is best modeled as a shift in criterion in a drift diffusion model, rather than signal detection, as drift diffusion accounts for this pattern of decision times. In Experiment 2 we replicate these findings while presenting stimuli in an rapid serial visual presentation ({RSVP}) stream. Experiments 1 and 2 were consistent with the conclusion that prevalence rate influences the item-by-item decision criterion, and are consistent with a drift diffusion model of this decision process.},

One hypothesis is that processing at the location of the scarf will temporarily remain enhanced, but recent electrophysiological evidence suggests that processing at that location is rapidly suppressed. Here, we show that reflexively orienting attention to a distractor boosts perceptual processing of subsequent items at that location and that an electrophysiological component thought to reflect distractor suppression reflects instead the enhancement of a subsequent item appearing at the same location. Enhancing the perceptual representation of an irrelevant object impairs search for the target, while enhancing the perceptual representation of the target itself facilitates search.},

Striatal projection neurons were identified by antidromic activation and fast-spiking {GABAergic} interneurons ({FSIs}) by their unique characteristics: briefer spike and burst responses. Juxtacellular injection of neurobiotin combined with parvalbumin immunohistochemistry validated this identification. Spontaneous activities and spike responses to cortical stimulation were recorded during both states of cortical activity: slow waves and desynchronization. Both {FSI} and projection neurons spontaneously discharged synchronously with slow waves at the maximum of cortical activity, but, on average, {FSIs} were much more active. Cortical desynchronization enhanced {FSI} activity and facilitated their spike responses to cortical stimulation, whereas opposite effects were observed regarding projection neurons. Experimental conditions favoring {FSI} discharge were always associated with a decrease in the firing activity of projection neurons. Spike responses to cortical stimulation occurred earlier (latency difference, 4.6 ms) and with a lower stimulation current for {FSIs} than for projection neurons. Moreover, blocking {GABA}
              A
              receptors by local picrotoxin injection enhanced the spike response of projection neurons, and this increase was larger in experimental conditions favoring {FSI} responses. Therefore, on average, {FSIs} exert

              a powerful feedforward inhibition on projection neurons. However, a few projection neurons were actually more sensitive to cortical stimulation than {FSIs}. Moreover, picrotoxin, which revealed {FSI} inhibition, preferentially affected projection neurons exhibiting the weakest sensitivity to cortical stimulation. Thus, feedforward inhibition by {FSIs} filters cortical information effectively transmitted by striatal projection neurons.},

Models of Parkinson's disease propose that dopaminergic degeneration imbalances both pathways, although direct electrophysiological evidence is lacking. Here, striatal neurons were identified by electrophysiological criteria and Neurobiotin labeling combined with either immunohistochemistry or

We showed that striatonigral neurons (direct pathway) were inhibited whereas striatopallidal neurons (indirect pathway) were activated by dopaminergic lesion. We also identified, with antidromic stimulations, corticostriatal neurons that preferentially innervate striatonigral or striatopallidal neurons and showed that dopaminergic depletion selectively decreased the spontaneous activity of the former. Therefore, dopamine degeneration induces a cascade of imbalances that spread out of the basal ganglia and affect the whole basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits.
            
            Fast-spiking {GABA} interneurons provide potent feedforward inhibition of striatal projection neurons. We showed here that these interneurons narrowed the time window of the responses of projection neurons to cortical stimulation. In the dopamine-depleted striatum, because the intrinsic activity of these interneurons was not altered, their feedforward inhibition worsened the striatal imbalance. Indeed, the time window of the evoked responses was narrower for striatonigral neurons and wider for striatopallidal neurons. Therefore, after dopaminergic depletion, cortical inputs and {GABA} interneurons might imbalance striatal projection neurons and represent two novel nondopaminergic mechanisms that might secondarily contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {Inferior temporal cortex ({IT}) is a key part of the ventral visual pathway implicated in object, face, and scene perception. But how does {IT} work? Here, I describe an organizational scheme that marries form and function and provides a framework for future research. The scheme consists of a series of stages arranged along the posterior-anterior axis of {IT}, deﬁned by anatomical connections and functional responses. Each stage comprises a complement of subregions that have a systematic spatial relationship. The organization of each stage is governed by an eccentricity template, and corresponding eccentricity representations across stages are interconnected. Foveal representations take on a role in high-acuity object vision (including face recognition); intermediate representations compute other aspects of object vision such as behavioral valence (using color and surface cues); and peripheral representations encode information about scenes. This multistage, parallelprocessing model invokes an innately determined organization reﬁned by visual experience that is consistent with principles of cortical development. The model is also consistent with principles of evolution, which suggest that visual cortex expanded through replication of retinotopic areas. Finally, the model predicts that the most extensively studied network within {IT}—the face patches—is not unique but rather one manifestation of a canonical set of operations that reveal general principles of how {IT} works.},

Several studies explored the effects and mechanisms of top-down attention, but the mechanisms that determine the attentional signal are less explored. By developing a neuro-computational model of visual attention including the visual cortex – basal ganglia loop, we demonstrate how attentional alignment can evolve based on dopaminergic reward during a visual search task. Unlike most previous modeling studies of feature-based attention, we do not implement a manually predeﬁned attention template. Dopamine-modulated covariance learning enable the basal ganglia to learn rewarded associations between the visual input and the attentional gain represented in the {PFC} of the model. Hence, the model shows human-like performance on a visual search task by optimally tuning the attention signal. In particular, similar as in humans, this reward-based tuning in the model leads to an attentional template that is not centered on the target feature, but a relevant feature deviating away from the target due to the presence of highly similar distractors. Further analyses of the model shows, attention is mainly guided by the signal to noise ratio between target and distractors.},

	abstract = {Animal learning is associated with changes in the efficacy of connections between neurons. The rules that govern this plasticity can be tested in neural networks. Rules that train neural networks to map stimuli onto outputs are given by supervised learning and reinforcement learning theories. Supervised learning is efficient but biologically implausible. In contrast, reinforcement learning is biologically plausible but comparatively inefficient. It lacks a mechanism that can identify units at early processing levels that play a decisive role in the stimulus-response mapping. Here we show that this so-called credit assignment problem can be solved by a new role for attention in learning. There are two factors in our new learning scheme that determine synaptic plasticity: (1) a reinforcement signal that is homogeneous across the network and depends on the amount of reward obtained after a trial, and (2) an attentional feedback signal from the output layer that limits plasticity to those units at earlier processing levels that are crucial for the stimulus-response mapping. The new scheme is called attention-gated reinforcement learning ({AGREL}). We show that it is as efficient as supervised learning in classification tasks. {AGREL} is biologically realistic and integrates the role of feedback connections, attention effects, synaptic plasticity, and reinforcement learning signals into a coherent framework.},

	abstract = {How do the multiple cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops interact? Are they parallel and fully independent or controlled by an arbitrator, or are they hierarchically organized? We introduce here a set of four key concepts, integrated and evaluated by means of a neuro-computational model, that bring together current ideas regarding cortex–basal ganglia interactions in the context of habit learning. According to key concept 1, each loop learns to select an intermediate objective at a different abstraction level, moving from goals in the ventral striatum to motor in the putamen. Key concept 2 proposes that the cortex integrates the basal ganglia selection with environmental information regarding the achieved objective. Key concept 3 claims shortcuts between loops, and key concept 4 predicts that loops compute their own prediction error signal for learning. Computational benefits of the key concepts are demonstrated. Contrasting with former concepts of habit learning, the loops collaborate to select goal-directed actions while training slower shortcuts develops habitual responses.},

	abstract = {Theories and models of the basal ganglia have mainly focused on the role of three different corticothalamic pathways: direct, indirect and hyperdirect. Although the indirect and the hyperdirect pathways are linked through the bidirectional connections between the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and the external globus pallidus ({GPe}), the role of their interactions has been mainly discussed in the context of a dysfunction (abnormal oscillations in Parkinson’s disease) and not of its function. We here propose a novel role for the loop formed by the {STN} and the {GPe}. We show, through a neuro-computational model, that this loop can bias the selection of actions during the exploratory period after a change in the environmental conditions towards alternative responses. Testing well-known alternative solutions before completely random actions can reduce the time required for the search of a new response after a rule change. Our simulations further show that the knowledge acquired by the indirect pathway can be transferred into a stable memory via learning in the hyperdirect pathway to establish the blocking of unwanted responses. After a rule switch, ﬁrst the indirect pathway learns to inhibit the previously correct actions. Once the new correct association is learned, the inhibition is transferred to the hyperdirect pathway through synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {In visual search for pop-out targets, search times are shorter when the target and nontarget colors from the previous trial are repeated than when they change. This priming effect was originally attributed to a feature weighting mechanism that biases attention toward the target features, and away from the non-target features. However, more recent studies have shown that visual selection is strongly context-dependent: according to a relational account of feature priming, the target color is always encoded relative to the non-target color (e.g., as redder or greener). The present study provides a critical test of this hypothesis, by varying the colors of the search items such that either the relative color or the absolute color of the target always remained constant (or both). The results clearly show that color priming depends on the relative color of a target with respect to the nontargets but not on its absolute color value. Moreover, the observed priming effects did not change over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the visual system encodes colors in a relative manner from the start of the experiment. Taken together, these results strongly support a relational account of feature priming in visual search, and are inconsistent with the dominant feature-based views.},

	abstract = {One of the most widespread views in vision research is that top-down control over visual selection is achieved by tuning attention to a particular feature value (e.g., red/yellow). Contrary to this view, previous spatial cueing studies showed that attention can be tuned to relative features of a search target (e.g., redder): An irrelevant distractor (cue) captured attention when it had the same relative color as the target (e.g., redder), and failed to capture when it had a different relative color, regardless of whether the distractor was similar or dissimilar to the target. The present study tested whether the same effects would be observed for eye movements when observers have to search for a color or shape target and when selection errors were very noticeable (resulting in an erroneous eye movement to the distractor). The results corroborated the previous findings, showing that capture by an irrelevant distractor does not depend on the distractor’s similarity to the target but on whether it matches or mismatches the relative attributes of the search target. Extending on previous work, we also found that participants can be pretrained to select a color target in virtue of its exact feature value. Contrary to the prevalent feature-based view, the results suggest that visual selection is preferentially biased toward the relative attributes of a search target. Simultaneously, however, visual selection can be biased to specific color values when the task requires it, which rules out a purely relational account of attention and eye movements.},

More speciﬁcally, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal’s performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

How is this representation transformed to bring about color perception? Prior work implicates populations of glob cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex ({PIT}; the V4 complex), but the correspondence between the neural representation of color in {PIT}/V4 complex and the organization of perceptual color space is unclear. We compared color-tuning data for populations of glob cells and interglob cells to predictions obtained using models that varied in the color-tuning narrowness of the cells, and the color preference distribution across the populations. Glob cells were best accounted for by simulated neurons that have nonlinear (narrow) tuning and, as a population, represent a color space designed to be perceptually uniform ({CIELUV}). Multidimensional scaling and representational similarity analyses showed that the color space representations in both glob and interglob populations were correlated with the organization of {CIELUV} space, but glob cells showed a stronger correlation. Hue could be classified invariant to luminance with high accuracy given glob responses and above-chance accuracy given interglob responses. Luminance could be read out invariant to changes in hue in both populations, but interglob cells tended to prefer stimuli having luminance contrast, regardless of hue, whereas glob cells typically retained hue tuning as luminance contrast was modulated. The combined luminance/hue sensitivity of glob cells is predicted for neurons that can distinguish two colors of the same hue at different luminance levels (orange/brown).},

Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, {PITd} and posterior {TEO} that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased {fMRI} hotspots, which we call “globs”, each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in the globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning, and some shape selectivity; cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in “inter-glob” regions were not color-tuned, but more strongly shape-selective. Neither population was direction-selective.

	abstract = {In order to investigate the neural coding of ordinate-level visual categories, single-cell recordings were made in the anterior temporal cortex of two rhesus monkeys performing a categorization of colour images of trees versus images of other objects. Neurons showed a high average degree of selectivity for these complex colour images. Although most neurons responded to trees and non-trees, about a quarter responded in a category-speciﬁc manner, e.g. to trees but not non-trees, and about one-tenth responded almost exclusively to exemplars of the trained category. The responses of these neurons were largely invariant for stimulus transformations, e.g. changes in position or size, and decreased with the degree of image scrambling, mimicking the behavioural results. However, the responses of single neurons were insufﬁciently stimulus invariant to accommodate the entire range of variability present in the features of exemplars within the same category. This strong within-category selectivity challenges the idea that a prototype is represented at the single neuron level, but suggests that ordinate-level categorization is based on a population of neurons, each selective for a limited set of exemplars.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that the reaction time of a saccade toward visual and/or auditory stimuli reﬂects the sensitivities of our oculomotor-orienting system to stimulus saliency. Endogenous factors, as well as stimulus-related factors, would also affect the saccadic reaction time ({SRT}). However, it was not clear how these factors interact and to what extent visual and auditory-targeting saccades are accounted for by common mechanisms. The present study examined the effect of, and the interaction between, stimulus saliency and audiovisual spatial congruency on the {SRT} for visual- and for auditory-target conditions. We also analyzed pre-target pupil size to examine the relationship between saccade preparation and pupil size. Pupil size is considered to reﬂect arousal states coupling with locus-coeruleus ({LC}) activity during a cognitive task. The main ﬁndings were that (1) the pattern of the examined effects on the {SRT} varied between visual- and auditory-auditory target conditions, (2) the effect of stimulus saliency was signiﬁcant for the visual-target condition, but not signiﬁcant for the auditorytarget condition, (3) Pupil velocity, not absolute pupil size, was sensitive to task set (i.e., visual-targeting saccade vs. auditory-targeting saccade), and (4) there was a signiﬁcant correlation between the pre-saccade absolute pupil size and the {SRTs} for the visualtarget condition but not for the auditory-target condition. The discrepancy between target modalities for the effect of pupil velocity and between the absolute pupil size and pupil velocity for the correlation with {SRT} may imply that the pupil effect for the visualtarget condition was caused by a modality-speciﬁc link between pupil size modulation and the {SC} rather than by the {LC}-{NE} (locus coeruleus-norepinephrine) system. These results support the idea that different threshold mechanisms in the {SC} may be involved in the initiation of saccades toward visual and auditory targets.},

We investigated the functional properties of neurons in extrastriate area V3. V3 receives inputs from both magno- and parvocellular pathways and has prominent projections to both the middle temporal area (area {MT}) and V4. It may therefore represent an important site for integration and transformation of visual signals. We recorded the activity of single units representing the central 10° in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We measured each cell's spatial, temporal, chromatic, and motion properties with the use of a variety of stimuli. Results were compared with measurements made in V2 neurons at similar eccentricities. Similar to area V2, most of the neurons in our sample (80\%) were orientation selective, and the distribution of orientation bandwidths was similar to that found in V2. Neurons in V3 preferred lower spatial and higher temporal frequencies than V2 neurons. Contrast thresholds of V3 neurons were extremely low. Achromatic contrast sensitivity was much higher than in V2, and similar to that found in {MT}. About 40\% of all neurons showed strong directional selectivity. We did not find strongly directional cells in layer 4 of V3, the layer in which the bulk of V1 and V2 inputs terminate. This property seems to be developed within area V3. An analysis of the responses of directionally selective cells to plaid patterns showed that in area V3, as in {MT} and unlike in V1 and V2, there exist cells sensitive to the motion of the plaid pattern rather than to that of the components. The exact proportion of cells classified as being selective to color depended to a large degree on the experiment and on the criteria used for classification. With the use of the same conditions as in a previous study of V2 cells, we found as many (54\%) color-selective cells as in V2 (50\%). Furthermore, the responses of V3 cells to colored sinusoidal gratings were well described by a linear combination of cone inputs. The two subpopulations of cells responsive to color and to motion overlapped to a large extent, and we found a significant proportion of cells that gave reliable and directional responses to drifting isoluminant gratings. Our results show that there is a significant interaction between color and motion processing in area V3, and that V3 cells exhibit the more complex motion properties typically observed at later stages of visual processing.},

	abstract = {The attentional template is often described as the mental representation that drives attentional selection and guidance, for instance, in visual search. Recent research suggests that this template is not a veridical repre­ sentation of the sought-for target, but instead an altered representation that allows more efficient search. The current paper contrasts two such theories. Firstly, the Optimal Tuning account which posits that the attentional template shifts to an exaggerated target value to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio between similar targets and non-targets. Secondly, the Relational account which states that instead of tuning to feature values, attention is directed to the relative value created by the search context, e.g. all redder items or the reddest item. Both theories are empirically supported, but used different paradigms (perceptual decision tasks vs. visual search), and different attentional measures (probe response accuracy vs. gaze capture). The current design incorporates both paradigms and measures. The results reveal that while Optimal Tuning shifts are observed in probe trials they do not drive early attention or eye- movement behaviour in visual search. Instead, early attention follows the Relational Account, selecting all items with the relative target colour (e.g., redder). This suggests that the masked probe trials used in Optimal Tuning do not probe the attentional template that guides attention. In Experiment 3 we find that optimal tuning shifts correspond in magnitude to purely perceptual shifts created by contrast biases in the visual search arrays. This suggests that the shift in probe responses may in fact be a perceptual artefact rather than a strategic adaptation to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio. These results highlight the distinction between early attentional mechanisms and later, target identification mechanisms.},

We hypothesize that feedback within the ventral pathway transfers the target template from prefrontal areas into intermediate areas like V4. The oculomotor circuit consisting of {FEF}, {LIP} and superior colliculus picks up this distributed activity and provides a continuous spatial reentry signal from premotor cells. In order to test this hypothesis, we simulate two experiments that require a response given a color cue. The ﬁrst experiment indicates a parallel feature-based enhancement prior to any spatial selection. If two targets are behaviorally relevant, as in the second experiment, experimental ﬁndings indicate that subjects split their attention between two locations containing the searched feature. Our simulation results suggest that the split in attention between two foci is a transient eﬀect occurring during competition. We predict that the time after cue presentation determines the state of this competition and ultimately the distribution of attention at diﬀerent locations. In addition we provide simulation results to explain how reentrant processing through the oculomotor circuit might lead to variations of the time for target detection in visual search.},

In seven experiments, we examined how the precision of target templates affects the ability to conduct visual search. Specifically, we degraded template precision in two ways: 1) by contaminating searchers’ templates with inaccurate features, and 2) by introducing extraneous features to the template that were unhelpful. We recorded eye movements to allow inferences regarding the relative extents to which attentional guidance and decision-making are hindered by template imprecision. Our findings support a dual-function theory of the target template and highlight the importance of examining template precision in visual search.},

To understand how feature attention is used to find and select objects for action, we focused on the ventral pre-arcuate ({VPA}) region of prefrontal cortex. In a visual search task, {VPA} cells responded selectively to search cues, maintained their feature selectivity throughout the delay and subsequent saccades, and discriminated the search target in their receptive fields with a timecourse earlier than in {FEF} or {IT} cortex. Inactivation of {VPA} impaired the animals’ ability to find targets, and simultaneous recordings in {FEF} revealed that the effects of feature attention were eliminated while leaving the effects of spatial attention in {FEF} intact. Altogether, the results suggest that {VPA} neurons compute the locations of objects with the features sought and send this information to {FEF} to guide eye movements to those relevant stimuli.},

	abstract = {To make perceptual judgments, the brain must decode the responses of sensory cortical neurons. The direction of visual motion is represented by the activity of direction-selective neurons. Because these neurons are often broadly tuned and their responses are inherently variable, the brain must appropriately integrate their responses to infer the direction of motion reliably. The optimal integration strategy is task dependent. For coarse direction discriminations, neurons tuned to the directions of interest provide the most reliable information, but for fine discriminations, neurons with preferred directions displaced away from the target directions are more informative. We measured coarse and fine direction discriminations with random-dot stimuli. Unbeknownst to the observers, we added subthreshold motion signals of different directions to perturb the responses of different groups of direction-selective neurons. The pattern of biases induced by subthreshold signals of different directions indicates that subjects’ choice behavior relied on the activity of neurons with a wide range of preferred directions. For coarse discriminations, observers’ judgments were most strongly determined by neurons tuned to the target directions, but for fine discriminations, neurons with displaced preferred directions had the largest influence. We conclude that perceptual decisions rely on a population decoding strategy that takes the statistical reliability of sensory responses into account.},

	abstract = {1. To analyze the selectivity and the sparseness of firing to visual stimuli of single neurons in the primate temporal cortical visual area, neuronal responses were measured to a set of 68 visual stimuli in macaques performing a visual fixation task. The population of neurons analyzed had responses that occurred primarily to faces. The stimuli included 23 faces, and 45 nonface images of real-world scenes, so that the function of this brain region could be analyzed when it was processing natural scenes. 2. The neurons were selected to meet the previously used criteria of face selectivity by responding more than twice as much to the optimal face as to the optimal nonface stimulus in the set. Application of information theoretic analyses to the responses of these neurons confirmed that their responses contained much more information about which of 20 face stimuli had been seen (on average 0.4 bits) than about which (of 20) nonface stimuli had been seen (on average 0.07 bits). 3. The sparseness of the representation of a scene or object provided by each of these neurons (which can be thought of as the proportion of stimuli to which the neuron responds, and which is fundamental to understanding the network operation of the system) can be defined as [formula: see text] where ri is the firing rate to the ith stimulus in the set of n stimuli. The sparseness has a maximal value of 1.0. It was found that the sparseness of the representation of the 68 stimuli by each neuron had an average across all neurons of 0.65. This indicates a rather distributed representation. 4. If the spontaneous firing rate was subtracted from the firing rate of the neuron to each stimulus, so that the changes of firing rate, i.e., the responses of the neurons, were used in the sparseness calculation, then the "response sparseness" had a lower value, with a mean of 0.33 for the population of neurons, or 0.60 if calculated over the set of faces. 5. Multidimensional scaling to produce a stimulus space represented by this population of neurons showed that the different faces were well separated in the space created, whereas the different nonface stimuli were grouped together in the space. 6. The information analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence that what was made explicit in the responses of these neurons was information about which face had been seen.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {The spiny projection neurons are by far the most numerous type of striatal neuron. In addition to being the principal projection neurons of the striatum, the spiny projection neurons also have an extensive network of local axon collaterals by which they make synaptic connections with other striatal projection neurons. However, up to now there has been no direct physiological evidence for functional inhibitory interactions between spiny projection neurons. Here we present new evidence that striatal projection neurons are interconnected by functional inhibitory synapses. To examine the physiological properties of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs}), dual intracellular recordings were made from pairs of spiny projection neurons in brain slices of adult rat striatum. Synaptic interactions were found in 9 of 45 pairs of neurons using averages of 200 traces that were triggered by a single presynaptic action potential. In all cases, synaptic interactions were unidirectional, and no bidirectional interactions were detected. Unitary {IPSPs} evoked by a single presynaptic action potential had a peak amplitude ranging from 157 to 319 μV in different connections (mean: 277 ± 46 μV, n = 9). The percentage of failures of single action potentials to evoke a unitary {IPSP} was estimated and ranged from 9 to 63\% (mean: 38 ± 14\%, n = 9). Unitary {IPSPs} were reversibly blocked by bicuculline ( n = 4) and had a reversal potential of −62.4 ± 0.7 {mV} ( n = 5), consistent with {GABA}-mediated inhibition. The findings of the present study correlate very well with anatomical evidence for local synaptic connectivity between spiny projection neurons and suggest that lateral inhibition plays a significant role in the information processing operations of the striatum.},

	abstract = {In visual search, the internal representation of the target feature is referred to as the attentional template. The attentional template can be broad or precise depending on the task requirements. In singleton search, the attentional template is broad because the target is the only colored element in the display. In feature search, a precise attentional template is required because the target is in a specific color in an array of varied colors. To measure the precision of the attentional template, we used a cue-target paradigm where cueing benefits decrease when the cue color differs from the target color. Consistent with broad and precise attentional templates, the decrease of cueing effects was stronger in feature than in singleton search. Measurements of {ERPs} showed that the N2pc elicited by the cue decreased with increasing color difference, suggesting that attention was more strongly captured by cues that were similar to the target. However, the cue-elicited N2pc did not differ between feature and singleton search, making it unlikely to reflect the mechanism underlying attentional template precision. Furthermore, there was no evidence for attentional suppression as there was no cue-elicited P
              D
              , even in conditions where the cueing benefit turned into a same-location cost. However, an index of signal enhancement, the contralateral positivity, reflected attention template precision. In general, there was sensory enhancement of the stimulus appearing at the cued location in the search display. With broad attentional templates, any stimulus at the cued location was enhanced, whereas enhancement was restricted to target-matching colors with precise attentional templates.},

Typically, {RTs} are shorter at the cued compared to uncued locations when the cue has the same color as the target. In contrast, cueing effects are absent or even inverted when cue and target colors are dissimilar. By systematically varying the difference between cue and target color, we calculated a function relating cue color to cueing effects. The width of this function reflects the precision of attentional selection and was compared to the precision of judgments of the target color on a color wheel. The precision of the memory representation was far better than the precision of attentional selection. When the task was made more difficult by increasing the similarity between the target and the nontarget stimuli in the target display, the precision of attentional selection increased, but was still worse than the precision of memory. When the search task was made more difficult, we also observed that for dissimilar cue colors, {RTs} were slower at cued than at uncued locations (i.e., same location costs), suggesting that improvements in attentional selectivity were achieved by suppressing non-target colors.},

Acting as a ﬁlter on perceptual representations, {VSA} allows preferential processing of relevant objects and concurrently inhibits traces of irrelevant items, thus preventing harmful distraction. Recent evidence showed that monetary rewards for performance on {VSA} tasks strongly affect immediately subsequent deployment of attention; a typical aftereffect of {VSA} (negative priming) was found only following highly rewarded selections. Here we report a much more striking demonstration that the controlled delivery of monetary rewards also affects attentional processing several days later. Thus, the propensity to select or to ignore speciﬁc visual objects appears to be strongly biased by the more or less rewarding consequences of past attentional encounters with the same objects.},

In the present study, we used stimuli evenly distributed on the {CIE}-xy chromaticity diagram to examine how luminance contrast affects neural representation of color in V4 and the anterior inferior temporal ({AITC}) and posterior inferior temporal ({PITC}) color areas (Banno et al., 2011). The activities of single neurons were recorded from monkeys performing a visual fixation task, and the effects of luminance contrast on the color selectivity of individual neurons and their population responses were systematically examined by comparing responses to color stimuli that were brighter or darker than the background. We found that the effects of luminance contrast differed considerably across V4 and the {PITC} and {AITC}. In both V4 and the {PITC}, the effects of luminance contrast on the population responses of color-selective neurons depended on color. In V4, the size of the effect was largest for blue and cyan, whereas in the {PITC}, the effect gradually increased as the saturation of the color stimulus was reduced, and was especially large with neutral colors (white, gray, black). The pattern observed in the {PITC} resembles the effect of luminance contrast on color appearance, suggesting {PITC} neurons are closely involved in the formation of the perceived appearance of color. By contrast, the color selectivities of {AITC} neurons were little affected by luminance contrast, indicating that hue and saturation of color stimuli are represented independently of luminance contrast in the {AITC}.},

We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features. We provide experimental evidence toward this through psychophysics experiments on human subjects, thus suggesting that humans deploy the optimal gain modulation strategy.},

	abstract = {Visual area V4 in the macaque monkey is a cortical area strongly involved in shape and color perception. However, fundamental questions about V4 are still debated. V4 was initially characterized as a color processing area but subsequent studies revealed that it contains a diverse complement of cells, including those with preference for color, orientation, disparity, as well as higher order feature preferences. This has led to disputes and uncertainty about the role of V4 in vision. In this study, using intrinsic signal optical imaging methods in awake, behaving monkeys, we demonstrate functional organization for different feature preferences within V4. Optical images reveal that regions with preferential response to color or luminance are largely separate from orientation selective regions. These results help resolve long-standing controversies regarding functional diversity and retinotopy within V4 and indicate the presence of spatially biased distribution of featural representation in V4 in the ventral visual pathway.},

Extensive evidence now indicates a role for the basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, in learning and memory. One prominent hypothesis is that this brain region mediates a form of learning in which stimulus-response (S-R) associations or habits are incrementally acquired. Support for this hypothesis is provided by numerous neurobehavioral studies in different mammalian species, including rats, monkeys, and humans. In rats and monkeys, localized brain lesion and pharmacological approaches have been used to examine the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning. In humans, study of patients with neurodegenerative diseases that compromise the basal ganglia, as well as research using brain neuroimaging techniques, also provide evidence of a role for the basal ganglia in habit learning. Several of these studies have dissociated the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning from those of a cognitive or declarative medial temporal lobe memory system that includes the hippocampus as a primary component. Evidence suggests that during learning, basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe memory systems are activated simultaneously and that in some learning situations competitive interference exists between these two systems.},

Whereas, numerous studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms of visual attention at the single neuron and population level in the visual cortices, considerably less work has been devoted to deciphering the distinct contribution of higher-order brain areas, which are known to be critical for the employment of attention. Among these areas, the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) has long been considered a source of top-down signals that bias selection in early visual areas in favor of the attended features. Here, we review recent experimental data that support the role of {PFC} in attention. We examine the existing evidence for functional specialization within {PFC} and we discuss how long-range interactions between {PFC} subregions and posterior visual areas may be implemented in the brain and contribute to the attentional modulation of different measures of neural activity in visual cortices.},

	abstract = {The probability of missing a target increases in low target prevalence search tasks. Wolfe and Van Wert (2010) propose 2 causes of this effect: reducing the quitting threshold, and conservatively shifting the decision making criterion used to evaluate each item. Reducing the quitting threshold predicts that target absent responses will be made without fully inspecting the display, increasing misses due to never inspecting the target (selection errors). The shift in decision criterion increases the likelihood of failing to recognize an inspected target (identification errors). Though there is robust evidence that target prevalence rates shift quitting thresholds, the proposed shift in decision making criterion has little support. In Experiment 1 we eye-tracked participants during searches of high, medium, and low prevalence. Eye movements were used to classify misses as selection or identification errors. Identification errors increased as prevalence decreased, supporting the claim that decision criterion becomes more conservative as prevalence decreases. In addition, as prevalence decreased, the dwell time on targets increased while dwell times on distractors decreased. We propose that the effect of prevalence on decision making for individual items is best modeled as a shift in criterion in a drift diffusion model, rather than signal detection, as drift diffusion accounts for this pattern of decision times. In Experiment 2 we replicate these findings while presenting stimuli in an rapid serial visual presentation ({RSVP}) stream. Experiments 1 and 2 were consistent with the conclusion that prevalence rate influences the item-by-item decision criterion, and are consistent with a drift diffusion model of this decision process.},

We here propose that the attentional feedback signals guide learning by suppressing plasticity of irrelevant features while permitting the learning of relevant ones.

The selectivity and sparseness of ﬁring to visual stimuli of single neurons in the primate inferior temporal visual cortex were measured to a set of 20 visual stimuli including objects and faces in macaques performing a visual ﬁxation task. Neurons were analysed with signiﬁcantly different responses to the stimuli. The ﬁring rate distribution of 36\% of the neurons was exponential. Twenty-nine percent of the neurons had too few low rates to be ﬁtted by an exponential distribution, and were ﬁtted by a gamma distribution. Interestingly, the raw ﬁring rate distribution taken across all neurons ﬁtted an exponential distribution very closely. The sparseness as or selectivity of the representation of the set of 20 stimuli provided by each of these neurons (which takes a maximal value of 1.0) had an average across all neurons of 0.77, indicating a rather distributed representation. The sparseness of the representation of a given stimulus by the whole population of neurons, the population sparseness ap, also had an average value of 0.77. The similarity of the average single neuron selectivity as and population sparseness for any one stimulus taken at any one time ap shows that the representation is weakly ergodic. For this to occur, the different neurons must have uncorrelated tuning proﬁles to the set of stimuli.},

According to some theories of attention, colors from different categories (i.e., red, green, blue, yellow) are represented independently. However, other accounts have proposed that these are related—either because color is ﬁltered through broad overlapping channels (4-channel view), or because colors are represented in one continuous feature space (e.g., {CIE} space) and search is governed by speciﬁc principles (e.g., linear separability between colors, or top-down tuning to relative colors). The present study tested these different views using a cueing experiment in which observers had to select one target color (e.g., red) and ignore two or four differently colored distractors that were presented prior to the target (cues). The results showed clear evidence for top-down contingent capture by colors, as a target-colored cue captured attention more strongly than differently colored cues. However, the results failed to support any of the proposed views that different color categories are related to one another by overlapping channels, linear separability, or relational guidance (N = 96).},

Previous research has shown that these internal representations of target features in memory are shifted away from nontarget features and that attention is tuned to the shifted feature especially when the target appeared with similar nontarget items. While previous studies have shown that the target–nontarget relationship has influence on the attentional selection and the representation shift when attentional template is maintained in long-term memory, there is little evidence for such effects when attentional template is stored in working memory. To address this issue, we asked participants to search for a target, which varied from trial to trial (working memory attentional template), or look for the target being stable across trials (long-term memory attentional template). We found that the shifted target features captured attention and that the representations of target features were deviated away from nontarget features when the target template was stored in either working memory or long-term memory. However, such effects were found to be greater for the attentional template in long-term memory. The present results provide evidence that one can encode the target–nontarget relationship even though the target varies from trial to trial, and such contextual information influences attentional selection and target representation shift even under this dynamically changing environment.},

	abstract = {In Parkinson’s disease, a loss of dopamine neurons causes severe motor impairments. These motor impairments have long been thought to result exclusively from immediate effects of dopamine loss on neuronal ﬁring in basal ganglia, causing imbalances of basal ganglia pathways. However, motor impairments and pathway imbalances may also result from dysfunctional synaptic plasticity – a novel concept of how Parkinsonian symptoms evolve. Here we built a neuro-computational model that allows us to simulate the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity in basal ganglia. Our simulations conﬁrm that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity can indeed explain the emergence of both motor impairments and pathway imbalances in Parkinson’s disease, thus corroborating the novel concept. By predicting that dysfunctional plasticity results not only in reduced activation of desired responses, but also in their active inhibition, our simulations provide novel testable predictions. When simulating dopamine replacement therapy (which is a standard treatment in clinical practice), we observe a new balance of pathway outputs, rather than a simple restoration of non-Parkinsonian states. In addition, high doses of replacement are shown to result in overshooting motor activity, in line with empirical evidence. Finally, our simulations provide an explanation for the intensely debated paradox that focused basal ganglia lesions alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, but do not impair performance in healthy animals. Overall, our simulations suggest that the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity play an essential role in the development of Parkinsonian symptoms, thus arguing for a re-conceptualisation of Parkinsonian pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

	abstract = {Humans are adept at distinguishing between stimuli that are very similar, an ability that is particularly crucial when the outcome is of serious consequence (e.g., for a surgeon or air-traffic controller). Traditionally, selective attention was thought to facilitate perception by increasing the gain of sensory neurons tuned to the defining features of a behaviorally relevant object (e.g., color, orientation, etc.). In contrast, recent mathematical models counterintuitively suggest that, in many cases, attentional gain should be applied to neurons that are tuned away from relevant features, especially when discriminating highly similar stimuli. Here we used psychophysical methods to critically evaluate these “ideal observer” models. The data demonstrate that attention enhances the gain of the most informative sensory neurons, even when these neurons are tuned away from the behaviorally relevant target feature. Moreover, the degree to which an individual adopted optimal attentional gain settings by the end of testing predicted success rates on a difficult visual discrimination task, as well as the amount of task improvement that occurred across repeated testing sessions (learning). Contrary to most traditional accounts, these observations suggest that the primary function of attentional gain is not to enhance the representation of target features per se, but instead to optimize performance on the current perceptual task. Additionally, individual differences in gain suggest that the operating characteristics of low-level attentional phenomena are not stable trait-like attributes and that variability in how attention is deployed may play an important role in determining perceptual abilities.},

However, when performing a difficult discrimination between two highly similar stimuli, perceptual decisions should instead be based on the activity of neurons tuned away from the relevant feature ( off-channel neurons) as these neurons undergo a larger firing rate change and are thus more informative. To test this hypothesis, we measured feature-selective responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) using functional magnetic resonance imaging and show that the degree of off-channel activation predicts performance on a difficult visual discrimination task. Moreover, this predictive relationship between off-channel activation and perceptual acuity is not simply the result of extensive practice with a specific stimulus feature (as in studies of perceptual learning).

	abstract = {Background: Attending to the spatial location or to nonspatial features of visual stimuli can modulate neuronal responses in primate visual cortex. The modulation by spatial attention changes the gain of sensory neurons and strengthens the representation of attended locations without changing neuronal selectivities such as directionality, i.e., the ratio of responses to preferred and anti-preferred directions of motion. Whether feature-based attention acts in a similar manner is unknown.
Results: To clarify this issue, we recorded the responses of 135 direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal area ({MT}) of two macaques to an unattended moving random dot pattern (the distractor) positioned inside a neuron’s receptive field while the animals attended to a second moving pattern positioned in the opposite hemifield. Responses to different directions of the distractor were modulated by the same factor (approximately 12\%) as long as the attended direction remained unchanged. On the other hand, systematically changing the attended direction from a neuron’s preferred to its anti-preferred direction caused a systematic change of the attentional modulation from an enhancement to a suppression, increasing directionality by about 20\%.
Conclusions: The results show that (1) feature-based attention exerts a multiplicative modulation upon neuronal responses and that the strength of this modulation depends on the similarity between the attended feature and the cell’s preferred feature, in line with the featuresimilarity gain model, and (2) at the level of the neuronal population, feature-based attention increases the selectivity for attended features by increasing the responses of neurons preferring this feature value while decreasing responses of neurons tuned to the opposite feature value.},

The neural mechanisms underlying such valuedriven attentional control are unknown. Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that the tail of the caudate nucleus and extrastriate visual cortex respond preferentially to task-irrelevant but previously reward-associated objects, providing an attentional priority signal that is sensitive to reward history. The caudate tail has not been implicated in the control of goal-directed or stimulus-driven attention, but is well suited to mediate the value-driven control of attention. Our findings reveal the neural basis of value-based attentional priority.},

We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the {BG}–{PFC} interplay. We propose that the {BG} bias {PFC} activity by removing the inhibition of cortico–thalamo–cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the {PFC}. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model's predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the {BG} with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico–{BG}–cortical loops.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Inspired by the idea that basal ganglia ({BG}) teach the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) to acquire category representations, we developed a novel neurocomputational model and tested it on a task that was recently applied in monkey experiments. As an advantage over previous models of category learning, our model allows to compare simulation data with single-cell recordings in {PFC} and {BG}. We not only derived model predictions, but already verified a prediction to explain the observed drop in striatal category selectivity. When testing our model with a simple, real-world face categorization task, we observed that the fast striatal learning with a performance of 85\% correct responses can teach the slower {PFC} learning to push the model performance up to almost 100\%.},

For example, an action followed by reward will be more readily elicited on subsequent encounters with the same stimuli and context—a phenomenon known as the law of effect. These consequences of rewards (and punishments) are important because they reinforce adaptive behaviors at the expense of competing ones, thus increasing ﬁtness of the organism in its environment. However, it is unknown whether similar inﬂuences regulate covert mental processes, such as visual selective attention. Visual selective attention allows privileged processing of task-relevant information, while inhibiting distracting contextual elements. Using variable monetary rewards as arbitrary feedback on performance, we tested whether acts of attentional selection, and in particular the resulting aftereffects, can be modulated by their consequences. Results show that the efﬁcacy of visual selective attention can be sensibly adjusted by external feedback. Specifically, although lingering inhibition of distractors is robust after highly rewarded selections, it is eliminated after poorly rewarded selections. This powerful feature of visual selective attention provides attentive processes with both ﬂexibility and self-regulation properties.},

            We recorded from single cells in area V2 of cynomolgus monkeys using standard acute recording techniques. After measuring each cell's spatial and temporal properties, we performed several tests of its chromatic properties using sine-wave gratings modulated around a mean gray background. Most cells behaved like neurons in area V1 and their responses were adequately described by a model that assumes a linear combination of cone signals. Unlike in V1, we found a subpopulation of cells whose activity was increased or inhibited by stimuli within a narrow range of color combinations. No particular color directions were preferentially represented. V2 cells showing color specificity, including cells showing narrow chromatic tuning, were present in any of the stripe compartments, as defined by cytochrome-oxidase ({CO}) staining. An addition of chromatic contrast facilitated the responses of most neurons to gratings with various luminance contrasts. Neurons in all three {CO} compartments gave significant responses to isoluminant gratings. Receptive-field properties of cells were generally similar for luminance and chromatically defined stimuli. We found only a small number of cells with a clearly identifiable double-opponent receptive-field organization.},

We present here the {ANNarchy} (Artiﬁcial Neural Networks architect) neural simulator, which allows to easily deﬁne and simulate rate-coded and spiking networks, as well as combinations of both. The interface in Python has been designed to be close to the {PyNN} interface, while the deﬁnition of neuron and synapse models can be speciﬁed using an equation-oriented mathematical description similar to the Brian neural simulator. This information is used to generate C++ code that will efﬁciently perform the simulation on the chosen parallel hardware (multi-core system or graphical processing unit). Several numerical methods are available to transform ordinary differential equations into an efﬁcient C++code. We compare the parallel performance of the simulator to existing solutions.},

We show that both working memory control and response selection can evolve within parallel and interacting cortico-basalganglio-thalamic loops by Hebbian and three-factor learning rules.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a blossoming of theories about the biological and physical basis of consciousness. Good theories guide empirical research, allowing us to interpret data, develop new experimental techniques and expand our capacity to manipulate the phenomenon of interest. Indeed, it is only when couched in terms of a theory that empirical discoveries can ultimately deliver a satisfying understanding of a phenomenon. However, in the case of consciousness, it is unclear how current theories relate to each other, or whether they can be empirically distinguished. To clarify this complicated landscape, we review four prominent theoretical approaches to consciousness: higher-o rder theories, global workspace theories, re-e ntry and predictive processing theories and integrated information theory. We describe the key characteristics of each approach by identifying which aspects of consciousness they propose to explain, what their neurobiological commitments are and what empirical data are adduced in their support. We consider how some prominent empirical debates might distinguish among these theories, and we outline three ways in which theories need to be developed to deliver a mature regimen of theory-t esting in the neuroscience of consciousness. There are good reasons to think that the iterative development, testing and comparison of theories of consciousness will lead to a deeper understanding of this most profound of mysteries.},

	abstract = {Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are known for their roles in motor control and motivated behavior. These two systems have been classically considered as independent structures that coordinate their contributions to behavior via separate cortico-thalamic loops. However, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of a rich set of direct connections between these two regions. Although there is strong evidence for connections in both directions, for brevity we limit our discussion to the better-characterized connections from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia. We review two sets of such connections: disynaptic projections through the thalamus and direct monosynaptic projections to the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei, the {VTA} and the {SNc}. In each case, we review the evidence for these pathways from anatomic tracing and physiological recordings, and discuss their potential functional roles. We present evidence that the disynaptic pathway through the thalamus is involved in motor coordination, and that its dysfunction contributes to motor deficits, such as dystonia. We then discuss how cerebellar projections to the {VTA} and {SNc} influence dopamine release in the respective targets of these nuclei: the {NAc} and the dorsal striatum. We argue that the cerebellar projections to the {VTA} may play a role in reward-based learning and therefore contribute to addictive behavior, whereas the projection to the {SNc} may contribute to movement vigor. Finally, we speculate how these projections may explain many of the observations that indicate a role for the cerebellum in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.},

We propose a hierarchical model that reveals V1/V2 encodings that are essential components for this transformation to the reported curvature representations in V4. Then, by relaxing the often-imposed prior of a single Gaussian, V4 shape selectivity is learned in the last layer of the hierarchy from Macaque V4 responses. We found that V4 cells integrate multiple shape parts from the full spatial extent of their receptive fields with similar excitatory and inhibitory contributions. Our results uncover new details in existing data about shape selectivity in V4 neurons that with further experiments can enhance our understanding of processing in this area. Accordingly, we propose designs for a stimulus set that allow removing shape parts awithout disturbing the curvature signal to isolate part contributions to V4 responses.
            
              Significance Statement:
            
            Selectivity to convex and concave shape parts in V4 neurons has been repeatedly reported. Nonetheless, the mechanisms that yield such selectivities in the ventral stream remain unknown. We propose a hierarchical computational model that incorporates findings of the various visual areas involved in shape processing and suggest mechanisms that transform the shape signal from low-level features to convex/concave part representations. Learning shape selectivity from Macaque V4 responses in the final processing stage in our model, we found that V4 neurons integrate shape parts from the full spatial extent of their receptive field with both facilitatory and inhibitory contributions. These results reveal hidden information in existing V4 data that with further experiments can enhance our understanding of processing in V4.},

	abstract = {When we use a novel tool, the motor commands may not produce the expected outcome. In healthy individuals, with practice the brain learns to alter the motor commands. This change depends critically on the cerebellum as damage to this structure impairs adaptation. However, it is unclear precisely what the cerebellum contributes to the process of adaptation in human motor learning. Is the cerebellum crucial for learning to associate motor commands with novel sensory consequences, called forward model, or is the cerebellum important for learning to associate sensory goals with novel motor commands, called inverse model? Here, we compared performance of cerebellar patients and healthy controls in a reaching task with a gradual perturbation schedule. This schedule allowed both groups to adapt their motor commands. Following training, we measured two kinds of behavior: in one case, people were presented with reach targets near the direction in which they had trained. The resulting generalization patterns of patients and controls were similar, suggesting comparable inverse models. In the second case, participants reached without a target and reported the location of their hand. In controls, the pattern of change in reported hand location was consistent with simulation results of a forward model that had learned to associate motor commands with new sensory consequences. In patients, this change was significantly smaller. Therefore, in our sample of patients, we observed that while adaptation of motor commands can take place despite cerebellar damage, cerebellar integrity appears critical for learning to predict visual sensory consequences of motor commands.},

	abstract = {Motor awareness is a complex, multifaceted construct involving the awareness of both (i) one’s motor state while executing a movement or remaining still and (ii) one’s motor abilities. The analysis of neurological syndromes associated with motor disorders suggests the existence of various different components which are, however, integrated into a model of motor awareness. These components are: (i) motor intention, namely, a conscious desire to perform an action; (ii) motor monitoring and error recognition, that is, the capacity to check the execution of the action and identify motor errors; and (iii) a general awareness of one’s own motor abilities and deficits, that is, the capacity to recognize the general state of one’s motor abilities about the performance of specific actions and the potential consequences of motor impairment. Neuroanatomical correlates involving the parietal and insular cortices, the medial and lateral frontal regions, and subcortical structures (basal ganglia and limbic system) support this multi-component model. Specific damage (or disconnections) to these structures results in a number of different disorders in motor awareness, such as anosognosia for hemiplegia and apraxia, and a number of symptoms which are specific to motor intention disorders (e.g., the Anarchic Hand Syndrome and Tourette’s Syndrome) or motor monitoring (e.g., Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases). All of these clinical conditions are discussed in the light of a motor awareness model.},

	abstract = {The relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. We set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. Specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45° counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45° away. Subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. Surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. The cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. Notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. These results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. This suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal.},

	abstract = {The incredible capability of the brain to quickly alter performance in response to ever-changing environment is rooted in the process of adaptation. The core aspect of adaptation is to fit an existing motor program to altered conditions. Adaptation to a visuomotor rotation or an external force has been well established as tools to study the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor adaptation. In this mini-review, we summarize recent findings from the field of visuomotor adaptation. We focus on the idea that the cerebellum plays a central role in the process of visuomotor adaptation and that interactions with cortical structures, in particular, the premotor cortex and the parietal cortex, may be crucial for this process. To this end, we cover a range of methodologies used in the literature that link cerebellar functions and visuomotor adaptation; behavioral studies in cerebellar lesion patients, neuroimaging and non-invasive stimulation approaches. The mini-review is organized as follows: first, we provide evidence that sensory prediction errors ({SPE}) in visuomotor adaptation rely on the cerebellum based on behavioral studies in cerebellar patients. Second, we summarize structural and functional imaging studies that provide insight into spatial localization as well as visuomotor adaptation dynamics in the cerebellum. Third, we discuss premotor — cerebellar interactions and how these may underlie visuomotor adaptation. And finally, we provide evidence from transcranial direct current and magnetic stimulation studies that link cerebellar activity, beyond correlational relationships, to visuomotor adaptation .},

Modulatory effects on neuronal processing and resulting behavioral changes are most commonly reported for higher order cognitive brain functions. Comparatively little is known about how neuromodulators shape processing in sensory brain areas that provide the signals for downstream regions to operate on. In this article, we review the current knowledge about how the monoamine neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline inﬂuence the representation of sensory stimuli in the mammalian sensory system. We review the functional organization of the monoaminergic brainstem neuromodulatory systems in relation to their role for sensory processing and summarize recent neurophysiological evidence showing that monoamines have diverse effects on early sensory processing, including changes in gain and in the precision of neuronal responses to sensory inputs. We also highlight the substantial evidence for complementarity between these neuromodulatory systems with different patterns of innervation across brain areas and cortical layers as well as distinct neuromodulatory actions. Studying the effects of neuromodulators at various target sites is a crucial step in the development of a mechanistic understanding of neuronal information processing in the healthy brain and in the generation and maintenance of mental diseases.},

The sub-cortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia have been proposed as a neural circuit that may contribute to resolving this explore-exploit ‘dilemma’. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of neuromodulating the basal ganglia’s output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, in patients who had undergone deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) for isolated dystonia. Neuromodulation enhanced the number of exploratory choices to the lower value option in a two-armed bandit probabilistic reversal-learning task. Enhanced exploration was explained by a reduction in the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) in a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model. We estimated the functional connectivity profile between the stimulating {DBS} electrode and the rest of the brain using a normative functional connectome derived from heathy controls. Variation in the extent of neuromodulation induced exploration between patients was associated with functional connectivity from the stimulation electrode site to a distributed brain functional network. We conclude that the basal ganglia’s output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, can adaptively modify decision choice when faced with the dilemma to explore or exploit.},

Here, we investigated how an auditory ‘‘go cue’’ transforms thalamocortical activity patterns and how these changes relate to movement initiation. Population responses in dentate/interpositus-recipient regions of motor thalamus reﬂect a time-locked increase in activity immediately prior to movement initiation that is temporally uncoupled from the go cue, indicative of a ﬁxed-latency feedforward motor timing signal. Blocking cerebellar or motor thalamic output suppresses movement initiation, while stimulation triggers movements in a behavioral context-dependent manner. Our ﬁndings show how cerebellar output, via the thalamus, shapes cortical activity patterns necessary for learned context-dependent movement initiation.},

Much of the information required for complex movements is generated by the cerebellum and the basal ganglia in conjunction with the cortex. Cerebellum and basal ganglia have been thought to communicate with each other only through slow multi-synaptic cortical loops, begging the question as to how they coordinate their outputs in real time. Here we show in mice that the cerebellum rapidly modulates the activity of the striatum via a disynaptic pathway. Under physiological conditions this short latency pathway is capable of facilitating optimal motor control by allowing the basal ganglia to incorporate timesensitive cerebellar information and by guiding the sign of cortico-striatal plasticity.

But causal evidence that these brief changes in firing actually serve as error signals to drive associative learning is more tenuous. While there is direct evidence that brief increases can substitute for positive prediction errors, there is no comparable evidence that similarly brief pauses can substitute for negative prediction errors. Lacking such evidence, the effect of increases in firing could reflect novelty or salience, variables also correlated with dopamine activity. Here we provide such evidence, showing in a modified Pavlovian overexpectation task that brief pauses in the firing of dopamine neurons in rat ventral tegmental area at the time of reward are sufficient to mimic the effects of endogenous negative prediction errors. These results support the proposal that brief changes in the firing of dopamine neurons serve as full-fledged bidirectional prediction error signals.},

Consequently, disentangling the contribution of {DA} neurons in reinforcing versus generating movements is challenging and has led to lasting controversy. We dissociated these functions by parametrically varying the timing of optogenetic manipulations in a Pavlovian conditioning task, and examining the influence on anticipatory licking prior to reward delivery. Inhibiting both ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) and substantia nigra pars compacta ({SNc}) {DA} neurons in the post-reward period had a significantly greater behavioral effect than inhibition in the pre-reward period of the task. Furthermore, the contribution of {DA} neurons to behavior decreased linearly as a function of elapsed time after reward. Together, the results indicate a temporally restricted role of {DA} neurons primarily related to reinforcing stimulus-reward associations, and suggest that directly generating movements is a comparatively less important function.},

            Behavioural feedback is critical for learning in the cerebral cortex. However, such feedback is often not readily available. How the cerebral cortex learns efficiently despite the sparse nature of feedback remains unclear. Inspired by recent deep learning algorithms, we introduce a systems-level computational model of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. In this model a cerebral recurrent network receives feedback predictions from a cerebellar network, thereby decoupling learning in cerebral networks from future feedback. When trained in a simple sensorimotor task the model shows faster learning and reduced dysmetria-like behaviours, in line with the widely observed functional impact of the cerebellum. Next, we demonstrate that these results generalise to more complex motor and cognitive tasks. Finally, the model makes several experimentally testable predictions regarding cerebro-cerebellar task-specific representations over learning, task-specific benefits of cerebellar predictions and the differential impact of cerebellar and inferior olive lesions. Overall, our work offers a theoretical framework of cerebro-cerebellar networks as feedback decoupling machines.},

            In Parkinson’s disease ({PD}), neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons occurs in the midbrain, specifically targeting the substantia nigra ({SN}), while leaving the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) relatively spared in early phases of the disease. Although the {SN} and {VTA} are known to be functionally dissociable in healthy adults, it remains unclear how this dissociation is altered in {PD}. To examine this issue, we performed a whole-brain analysis to compare functional connectivity in {PD} to healthy adults using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) data compiled from three independent datasets. Our analysis showed that across the sample, the {SN} had greater connectivity with the precuneus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and areas of the occipital cortex, partially replicating our previous work in healthy young adults. Notably, we also found that, in {PD}, {VTA}-right cerebellum connectivity was higher than {SN}-right cerebellum connectivity, whereas the opposite trend occurred in healthy controls. This double dissociation may reflect a compensatory role of the cerebellum in {PD} and could provide a potential target for future study and treatment.},

A pharmacogenetic approach was used to activate midbrain dopamine neurons, and behavioral assays were conducted to determine the effects on mouse activity levels.

Similar elevated plus maze performances between lesioned and sham animals indicated that anxiety did not inﬂuence task performance.

	abstract = {Growing evidence associates cerebellar abnormalities with several neuropsychiatric disorders in which compulsive symptomatology and impulsivity are part of the disease pattern. Symptomatology of autism, addiction, obsessive-compulsive ({OCD}), and attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity ({ADHD}) disorders transcends the sphere of motor dysfunction and essentially entails integrative processes under control of prefrontalthalamic-cerebellar loops. Patients with brain lesions affecting the cortico-striatum thalamic circuitry and the cerebellum indeed exhibit compulsive symptoms. Speciﬁcally, lesions of the posterior cerebellar vermis cause affective dysregulation and deﬁcits in executive function. These deﬁcits may be due to impairment of one of the main functions of the cerebellum, implementation of forward internal models of the environment. Actions that are independent of internal models may not be guided by predictive relationships or a mental representation of the goal. In this review article, we explain how this deﬁcit might affect executive functions. Additionally, regionalized cerebellar lesions have been demonstrated to impair other brain functions such as the emergence of habits and behavioral inhibition, which are also altered in compulsive disorders. Similar to the infralimbic cortex, clinical studies and research in animal models suggest that the cerebellum is not required for learning goal-directed behaviors, but it is critical for habit formation. Despite this accumulating data, the role of the cerebellum in compulsive symptomatology and impulsivity is still a matter of discussion. Overall, ﬁndings point to a modulatory function of the cerebellum in terminating or initiating actions through regulation of the prefrontal cortices. Speciﬁcally, the cerebellum may be crucial for restraining ongoing actions when environmental conditions change by adjusting prefrontal activity in response to the new external and internal stimuli, thereby promoting ﬂexible behavioral control. We elaborate on this explanatory framework and propose a working hypothesis for the involvement of the cerebellum in compulsive and impulsive endophenotypes.},

A decade later, mounting evidence strongly suggests the cerebellar involvement in this disorder. Nevertheless, direct evidence is still partial and related mainly to drug-induced reward memory, but recent results about cerebellar functions may provide new insights into its role in addiction. The present review does not intend to be a compelling revision on available ﬁndings, as we did in the two previous reviews. This minireview focuses on speciﬁc ﬁndings of the cerebellum’s role in drug-related reward memories and the way ahead for future research. The results discussed here provide grounds for involving the cerebellar cortex’s apical region in regulating behavior driven by drug-cue associations. They also suggest that the cerebellar cortex dysfunction may facilitate drug-induced learning by increasing glutamatergic output from the deep cerebellar nucleus ({DCN}) to the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) and neural activity in its projecting areas.},

Classical theories posit that a large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to sense fine contextual changes2–6. Although evidence suggests a role for cerebellum in cognition7–10, granule cells are known to encode only sensory11–13 and motor14 context. Using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, here we show that granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated voluntary forelimb movements for delayed water reward. Some granule cells responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-anticipating responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward delivery, whereas reward omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed. The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a major departure from current understanding of these neurons and dramatically enriches contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells, with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum.},

Indeed, it is now well accepted that addictive drugs produce long-lasting molecular and structural plasticity changes in corticostriatal-limbic loops. However, there are brain regions that might be relevant to addiction other than the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and basal ganglia. In addition to these circuits, a growing amount of data suggests the involvement of the cerebellum in many of the brain functions affected in addicts, though this region has been overlooked, traditionally, in the addiction field. Therefore, in the present review we provide seven arguments as to why we should consider the cerebellum in drug addiction. We present and discuss compelling evidence about the effects of drugs of abuse on cerebellar plasticity, the involvement of the cerebellum in drug-induced cue-related memories, and several findings showing that the instrumental memory and executive functions also recruit the cerebellar circuitry. In addition, a hypothetical model of the cerebellum's role relative to other areas within corticostriatal-limbic networks is also provided.

	abstract = {All neuronal circuits are subject to neuromodulation. Modulatory effects on neuronal processing and resulting behavioral changes are most commonly reported for higher order cognitive brain functions. Comparatively little is known about how neuromodulators shape processing in sensory brain areas that provide the signals for downstream regions to operate on. In this article, we review the current knowledge about how the monoamine neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline inﬂuence the representation of sensory stimuli in the mammalian sensory system. We review the functional organization of the monoaminergic brainstem neuromodulatory systems in relation to their role for sensory processing and summarize recent neurophysiological evidence showing that monoamines have diverse effects on early sensory processing, including changes in gain and in the precision of neuronal responses to sensory inputs. We also highlight the substantial evidence for complementarity between these neuromodulatory systems with different patterns of innervation across brain areas and cortical layers as well as distinct neuromodulatory actions. Studying the effects of neuromodulators at various target sites is a crucial step in the development of a mechanistic understanding of neuronal information processing in the healthy brain and in the generation and maintenance of mental diseases.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease ({PD}), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with {PD}. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in {PD}.
Methods: The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of {PD} and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels {EEG}. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb.
Results: Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition (P {\textless} 0.05). When patients were {OFF} medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset (P {\textless} 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when {ON} medication (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no signiﬁcant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients.
Conclusion: These results conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Abnormal initiation and control of voluntary movements are among the principal manifestations of Parkinson’s disease ({PD}). However, the processes underlying these abnormalities and their potential remediation by dopamine treatment remain poorly understood. Normally, movements depend on the integration of sensory information with the predicted consequences of action. This integration leads to a suppression in the intensity of predicted sensations, reflected in a ‘sensory attenuation’. We examined this integration process and its relation to dopamine in {PD}, by measuring sensory attenuation. Patients with idiopathic {PD} (n = 18) and population-derived controls (n = 175) matched a set of target forces applied to their left index finger by a torque motor. To match the force, participants either pressed with their right index finger (‘Direct’ condition) or moved a knob that controlled a motor through a linear potentiometer (‘Slider’ condition). We found that despite changes in sensitivity to different forces, overall sensory attenuation did not differ between medicated {PD} patients and controls. Importantly, the degree of attenuation was negatively related to {PD} motor severity but positively related to individual patient dopamine dose, as measured by levodopa dose equivalent. The results suggest that dopamine could regulate the integration of sensorimotor prediction with sensory information to facilitate the control of voluntary movements.},

To implement these processes, their brain must be organised in a suitable hierarchical fashion. Here we brieﬂy review two types of neural/behavioural/computational literatures, focussed respectively on cortex and on sub-cortical areas, and highlight their important limitations. Then we review two computational modelling works of the authors that exemplify the problems, brain areas, experiments, main concepts and limitations of the two research threads. Finally we propose a theoretical integration of the two views, showing how this allows to solve most of the problems found by the two accounts if taken in isolation. The overall picture that emerges is that the cortical and the basal ganglia systems form two highly-organised hierarchical systems working in close synergy and jointly solving all the challenges of choice, selection, and implementation needed to acquire and express adaptive behaviour.},

A good interpretation of neurobiological findings involves a computational model that simulates signal processing of the visual cortex. In part, this is likely achieved step by step from early to late areas of visual perception. While several algorithms have been proposed for learning feature detectors, only few studies at hand cover the issue of biologically plausible learning of such invariance. In this study, a set of Hebbian learning rules based on calcium dynamics and homeostatic regulations of single neurons is proposed. Their performance is verified within a simple model of the primary visual cortex to learn so-called complex cells, based on a sequence of static images. As a result, the learned complex-cell responses are largely invariant to phase and position.},

In robotics, a model of the robot is an indispensable component that enables to control the machine. This chapter compares the character of body representations in biology with their robotic counterparts and relates that to the differences in performance observed. Conclusions are drawn about how robots can inform the biological sciences dealing with body representations and which of the features of the ‘body in the brain’ should be transferred to robots, giving rise to more adaptive and resilient self-calibrating machines.},

A pattern theory of self helps to clarify various interpretations of self as compatible or commensurable instead of thinking them in opposition, and it helps to show how various aspects of self may be related across certain dimensions.

Here, we study how spontaneous self-contacts can provide material for learning implicit models of the body and its action possibilities in the environment. Specifically, we investigate the space of only somatosensory (tactile and proprioceptive) activations during self-touch configurations in a simple model agent. Using biologically motivated overlapping receptive fields in these modalities, a variational autoencoder ({VAE}) in a denoising framework is trained on these inputs. The denoising properties of the {VAE} can be exploited to fill in the missing information. In particular, if tactile stimulation is provided on a single body part, the model provides a configuration that is closer to a previously experienced self-contact configuration. Iterative passes through the {VAE} reconstructions create a control loop that brings about reaching for stimuli on the body. Furthermore, due to the generative properties of the model, previously unsampled proprioceptive-tactile configurations can also be achieved. In the future, we will seek a closer comparison with empirical data on the kinematics of spontaneous self-touch in infants and the results of reaching for stimuli on the body.},

We combined manual scoring of video recordings with an automatic extraction of motion data in order to study infants’ behavioral patterns and developmental progression such as: (i) spatial distribution of self-touches on the body, (ii) spatial patterns and regularities of hand movements, (iii) midline crossing, (iv) preferential use of one arm, and (v) dynamic patterns of movements indicative of goal-directedness. From the patterns observed in this pilot data set, we can speculate on the development of first body and peripersonal space representations. Several methods of extracting 3D kinematics from videos have recently been made available by the computer vision community. We applied one of these methods on infant videos and provide guidelines on its possibilities and limitations—a methodological contribution to automating the analysis of infant videos.

	abstract = {Synthetic psychology describes the approach of “understanding through building” applied to the human condition. In this chapter, we consider the speciﬁc challenge of synthesizing a robot “sense of self”. Our starting hypothesis is that the human self is brought into being by the activity of a set of transient self-processes instantiated by the brain and body. We propose that we can synthesize a robot self by developing equivalent sub-systems within an integrated biomimetic cognitive architecture for a humanoid robot. We begin the chapter by motivating this work in the context of the criteria for recognizing other minds, and the challenge of benchmarking artiﬁcial intelligence against human, and conclude by describing efforts to create a sense of self for the {iCub} humanoid robot that has ecological, temporally-extended, interpersonal and narrative components set within a multi-layered model of mind.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms of infant development are far from understood. Learning about one’s own body is likely a foundation for subsequent development. Here we look speciﬁcally at the problem of how spontaneous touches to the body in early infancy may give rise to ﬁrst body models and bootstrap further development such as reaching competence. Unlike visually elicited reaching, reaching to own body requires connections of the tactile and motor space only, bypassing vision. Still, the problems of high dimensionality and redundancy of the motor system persist. In this work, we present an embodied computational model on a simulated humanoid robot with artiﬁcial sensitive skin on large areas of its body. The robot should autonomously develop the capacity to reach for every tactile sensor on its body. To do this efﬁciently, we employ the computational framework of intrinsic motivations and variants of goal babbling—as opposed to motor babbling—that prove to make the exploration process faster and alleviate the ill-posedness of learning inverse kinematics. Based on our results, we discuss the next steps in relation to infant studies: what information will be necessary to further ground this computational model in behavioral data.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, cognitive models of multisensory integration in human beings have been developed and applied to model human body experience. Recent research indicates that Bayesian and connectionist models might push developments in various branches of robotics: assistive robotic devices might adapt to their human users aiming at increased device embodiment, e.g., in prosthetics, and humanoid robots could be endowed with human-like capabilities regarding their surrounding space, e.g., by keeping safe or socially appropriate distances to other agents. In this perspective paper, we review cognitive models that aim to approximate the process of human sensorimotor behavior generation, discuss their challenges and potentials in robotics, and give an overview of existing approaches. While model accuracy is still subject to improvement, human-inspired cognitive models support the understanding of how the modulating factors of human body experience are blended. Implementing the resulting insights in adaptive and learning control algorithms could help to taylor assistive devices to their user’s individual body experience. Humanoid robots who develop their own body schema could consider this body knowledge in control and learn to optimize their physical interaction with humans and their environment. Cognitive body experience models should be improved in accuracy and online capabilities to achieve these ambitious goals, which would foster human-centered directions in various ﬁelds of robotics.},

Specifically, mechanisms involving sensorimotor learning, prediction, and self-other distinction, can be assessed with artificial agents.

We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the proposed model in two experiments: a simple ego-noise classiﬁcation task, where we also show the capabilities of the model to produce predictions in absence of input modalities; an egonoise suppression experiment, where we show the effects in the ego-noise suppression performance of coherent and incoherent proprioceptive and motor information passed as inputs to the predictive process implemented by a forward model. In line with what has been proposed by several behavioural and neuroscience studies, our experiments show that ego-noise attenuation is more pronounced when the robot is the owner of the action. When this is not the case, sensory attenuation is worse, as the incongruence of the proprioceptive and motor information with the perceived ego-noise generates bigger prediction errors, which may constitute an element of surprise for the agent and allow it to distinguish between selfgenerated actions and those generated by other individuals. We argue that these phenomena can represent cues for a sense of agency in artiﬁcial agents.},

It is also indispensable knowledge to perform stereotaxic surgery for movement disorders. Here I would like to describe the somatotopic organization of the basal ganglia, which consist of the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. Projections from motor cortical regions representing different body parts terminate in different regions of these nuclei. Basal ganglia neurons respond not only to the stimulation of the corresponding regions of the motor cortices, but also to active and passive movements of the corresponding body parts. On the basis of these anatomical and physiological findings, somatotopic organization can be identified in the motor territories of these nuclei in the basal ganglia. In addition, projections from functionally interrelated cortical areas partially converge through the cortico-basal ganglia loop, but nevertheless the somatotopy is still preserved. Disorganized somatotopy may explain, at least in part, the pathophysiology of movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and dystonia.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Scientists have long conjectured that the neocortex learns the structure of the environment in a predictive, hierarchical manner. According to this conjecture, expected, predictable features are differentiated from unexpected ones by comparing bottom-up and top-down streams of information. It is theorized that the neocortex then changes the representation of incoming stimuli, guided by differences in the responses to expected and unexpected events. In line with this conjecture, different responses to expected and unexpected sensory features have been observed in spiking and somatic calcium events. However, it remains unknown whether these unexpected event signals occur in the distal apical dendrites where many top-down signals are received, and whether these signals govern subsequent changes in the brain’s stimulus representations. Here, we show that both somata and distal apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit distinct unexpected event signals that systematically change over days. These findings were obtained by tracking the responses of individual somata and dendritic branches of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons over multiple days in primary visual cortex of awake, behaving mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Many neurons in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their responses to expected and unexpected events. Interestingly, these responses evolved in opposite directions in the somata and distal apical dendrites. These differences between the somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments tend to receive bottom-up and top-down information, respectively.},

            During navigation, rodents continually sample the environment with their whiskers. How locomotion modulates neuronal activity in somatosensory cortex, and how it is integrated with whisker-touch remains unclear. Here, we compared neuronal activity in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 of barrel cortex using calcium imaging in mice running in a tactile virtual reality. Both layers increase their activity during running and concomitant whisking, in the absence of touch. Fewer neurons are modulated by whisking alone. Whereas L5 neurons respond transiently to wall-touch during running, L2/3 neurons show sustained activity. Consistently, neurons encoding running-with-touch are more abundant in L2/3 and they encode the run-speed better during touch. Few neurons across layers were also sensitive to abrupt perturbations of tactile flow during running. In summary, locomotion significantly enhances barrel cortex activity across layers with L5 neurons mainly reporting changes in touch conditions and L2/3 neurons continually integrating tactile stimuli with running.},

Here, we show that the coupling between motor output and visual feedback is necessary for the functional development of visual processing in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse. Using a virtual reality system, we reared mice in conditions of normal or random visuomotor coupling. We recorded the activity of identiﬁed excitatory and inhibitory L2/3 neurons in response to transient visuomotor mismatches in both groups of mice. Mismatch responses in excitatory neurons were strongly experience dependent and driven by a transient release from inhibition mediated by somatostatin-positive interneurons. These data are consistent with a model in which L2/3 of V1 computes a difference between an inhibitory visual input and an excitatory locomotion-related input, where the balance between these two inputs is ﬁnely tuned by visuomotor experience.},

	abstract = {Of the various attempts to generalize information theory to multiple variables, the most widely utilized, interaction information, suffers from the problem that it is sometimes negative. Here we reconsider from first principles the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities. Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.},

            With Hebbian learning ‘who fires together wires together’, well-known problems arise. Hebbian plasticity can cause unstable network dynamics and overwrite stored memories. Because the known homeostatic plasticity mechanisms tend to be too slow to combat unstable dynamics, it has been proposed that plasticity must be highly gated and synaptic strengths limited. While solving the issue of stability, gating and limiting plasticity does not solve the stability-plasticity dilemma. We propose that dendrites enable both stable network dynamics and considerable synaptic changes, as they allow the gating of plasticity in a compartment-specific manner. We investigate how gating plasticity influences network stability in plastic balanced spiking networks of neurons with dendrites. We compare how different ways to gate plasticity, namely via modulating excitability, learning rate, and inhibition increase stability. We investigate how dendritic versus perisomatic gating allows for different amounts of weight changes in stable networks. We suggest that the compartmentalisation of pyramidal cells enables dendritic synaptic changes while maintaining stability. We show that the coupling between dendrite and soma is critical for the plasticity-stability trade-off. Finally, we show that spatially restricted plasticity additionally improves stability.},

	abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.
            
              It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain’s attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on
              empirical Bayes
              and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective.
            
            In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity ({MMN}) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the {MMN} and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

	abstract = {Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Importantly, if the aim is to create robots that can continuously develop through interactions with their environment, their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e. controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in {AI} and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of {AI} and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.},

	abstract = {Dopamine ({DA}) loss in Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) causes debilitating motor deficits. However, dopamine is also widely linked to reward prediction and learning, and the contribution of dopamine-dependent learning to movements that are impaired in {PD}—which often do not lead to explicit rewards—is unclear. Here, we used two distinct motor tasks to dissociate dopamine’s acute motoric effects vs. its long-lasting, learning-mediated effects. In dopamine-depleted mice, motor task performance gradually worsened with task exposure. Task experience was critical, as mice that remained in the home cage during the same period were relatively unimpaired when subsequently probed on the task. Repeated dopamine replacement treatments acutely rescued deficits and gradually induced long-term rescue that persisted despite treatment withdrawal. Surprisingly, both long-term rescue and parkinsonian performance decline were task specific, implicating dopamine-dependent learning. D1R activation potently induced acute rescue that gradually consolidated into long-term rescue. Conversely, reduced D2R activation potently induced parkinsonian decline. In dopamine-depleted mice, either D1R activation or D2R activation prevented parkinsonian decline, and both restored balanced activation of direct vs. indirect striatal pathways. These findings suggest that reinforcement and maintenance of movements—even movements not leading to explicit rewards—are fundamental functions of dopamine and provide potential mechanisms for the hitherto unexplained “long-duration response” by dopaminergic therapies in {PD}.},

Recently it has been shown that backprop in multilayerperceptrons ({MLPs}) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies solely on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in {MLPs}, but rather in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding {CNNs}, {RNNs}, and the more complex {LSTMs}, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely distributed neuromorphic architectures.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind these advances – error backpropagation – appears to be at odds with neurobiology.

In contrast to previous work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback. Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and classiﬁcation tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic credit assignment problem.},

            To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy. An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error backpropagation algorithm. However, in this algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Several models have been proposed that approximate the backpropagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules. Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity. Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the backpropagation algorithm. This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output.},

Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the deﬁning feature of “primary states” is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit “criticality,” i.e., the property of being poised at a “critical” point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the defaultmode network ({DMN}) and a decoupling between the {DMN} and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally signiﬁcantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

            Prediction is an essential part of life. However, are we really “good” at making predictions? More specifically, are pieces of our brain close to being optimal predictors? To assess the efficiency of prediction, we need to measure the information that neurons carry about the future of our sensory experiences. We show how to do this, at least in simplified contexts, and find that groups of neurons in the retina indeed are close to maximally efficient at separating predictive information from the nonpredictive background. Efficient coding of predictive information is a principle that can be applied at every stage of neural computation.

            Guiding behavior requires the brain to make predictions about the future values of sensory inputs. Here, we show that efficient predictive computation starts at the earliest stages of the visual system. We compute how much information groups of retinal ganglion cells carry about the future state of their visual inputs and show that nearly every cell in the retina participates in a group of cells for which this predictive information is close to the physical limit set by the statistical structure of the inputs themselves. Groups of cells in the retina carry information about the future state of their own activity, and we show that this information can be compressed further and encoded by downstream predictor neurons that exhibit feature selectivity that would support predictive computations. Efficient representation of predictive information is a candidate principle that can be applied at each stage of neural computation.},

In this paper, we describe selfrecognition as a process that is built on top of body perception unconscious mechanisms. We present an algorithm that enables a robot to perform non-appearance self-recognition on a mirror and distinguish its simple actions from other entities, by answering the following question: am I generating these sensations? The algorithm combines active inference, a theoretical model of perception and action in the brain, with neural network learning. The robot learns the relation between its actions and its body with the effect produced in the visual ﬁeld and its body sensors. The prediction error generated between the models and the real observations during the interaction is used to infer the body conﬁguration through free energy minimization and to accumulate evidence for recognizing its body. Experimental results on a humanoid robot show the reliability of the algorithm for different initial conditions, such as mirror recognition in any perspective, robot-robot distinction and human-robot differentiation.},

This buildup is presumed to reflect the final stages of planning and preparation for movement. Here we present a different interpretation of the premovement buildup. We used a leaky stochastic accumulator to model the neural decision of “when” to move in a task where there is no specific temporal cue, but only a general imperative to produce a movement after an unspecified delay on the order of several seconds. According to our model, when the imperative to produce a movement is weak, the precise moment at which the decision threshold is crossed leading to movement is largely determined by spontaneous subthreshold fluctuations in neuronal activity. Time locking to movement onset ensures that these fluctuations appear in the average as a gradual exponential-looking increase in neuronal activity. Our model accounts for the behavioral and electroencephalography data recorded from human subjects performing the task and also makes a specific prediction that we confirmed in a second electroencephalography experiment: Fast responses to temporally unpredictable interruptions should be preceded by a slow negative-going voltage deflection beginning well before the interruption itself, even when the subject was not preparing to move at that particular moment.
          , 
            Author Summary
            
              The role of ongoing spontaneous fluctuations in neural activity has been widely studied in the domain of perceptual decision making, but their potential role in self-initiated movement has been largely overlooked. The model that we have introduced here unifies perceptual decision making and spontaneous or “voluntary” movement generation. It may generalize to other contexts where unpredictable spontaneous behavior is called for, such as in certain sports, musical improvisation, or game theory. Our work may also inform the development of asynchronous brain–computer interfaces, because spontaneous fluctuations in motor-related activity may be a source of false positives when trying to detect a user’s intentions in real time. Most importantly, our work may help to resolve “Libet’s paradox” (
              3
              ): Why should there be such a long and highly variable gap between the time of a motor decision and the subjective estimate of the time of the motor decision? In fact, this question arises only when we assume that the motor decision coincides in time with the onset of the {RP}. We have argued that this need not be the case and that the neural decision to move may come much closer in time to the movement itself, coincident with average subjective estimates of the time of the intention to move (
              3
              ).
            
            
              One limitation of our model is that it treats each trial as completely independent of the one before it, although empirically we observed a clear relationship (positive correlation) between the waiting times on trials
              t
              and
              t
              − 1. The model is also silent with regard to a variety of other factors that might contribute to determining the waiting time on each trial. For example, subjects may strategically try to produce a “random” distribution of waiting times across trials. These factors could be incorporated into a future model, but it is important to note that the model was able to account for our data with only three free parameters.
            
            Simulations showed that when the model is “interrupted” at random times and forced to produce a speeded response, the fastest responses are preceded by a gradual “buildup” (in the direction of the threshold) that long precedes the interruption itself, whereas the slower responses are not. Remarkably, we found the same to be true of our empirical data. Of course, it could be that fast responses were fast because the subject just happened to be preparing a spontaneous movement when the click occurred. We anticipated this possible interpretation and so asked subjects to say the word “coincidence” if they ever felt that they were about to make a movement at the time of the click, and these trials, although rare, were excluded from the analysis. Other interpretations could also be ruled out. Thus, the {RP}, which appears to be an intentional goal-directed buildup, might instead reflect ongoing random fluctuations in neural activity.
            
              In addition, our model also directed us to a specific prediction that we tested with a second {EEG} experiment. Implicit in our model is the notion that the motor system constantly undergoes covert fluctuations that bring it closer to or farther from threshold. We reasoned that we should be able to capture these ongoing fluctuations by randomly interrupting subjects with a compulsory response cue and sorting trials by their reaction times. We used a variant of Libet’s task that we refer to as
              Libetus interruptus
              : Subjects perform the standard Libet task, but are told that they may sometimes be interrupted by an auditory “click,” in which case they are to perform the movement (a button press) immediately and as quickly as possible (
              
                Fig. P1,
                Bottom
              
              ). Assuming that the interrupted responses arise from the same decision accumulator as the self-initiated ones, short response times should come primarily from trials in which the spontaneous fluctuations were already close to threshold. Hence, fast sensory-cued responses should also be preceded by a readiness potential.
            
            
              Our experimental results show that a decision threshold applied to autocorrelated noise—in this case the output of a leaky stochastic accumulator—can account for the specific shape of the {RP} as well as the distribution of waiting times from subjects performing Libet et al.’s (
              3
              ) spontaneous-movement task. We replicated Libet’s (1983) behavioral and electroencephalography ({EEG}) results and validated our model by fitting the shape of the {RP}, using parameters chosen by fitting the distribution of threshold-crossing times in the model to the empirical distribution of waiting times.
            
            
              According to the model, when the imperative to produce a movement is weak and nonspecific (as in Libet’s task), the precise moment at which the decision threshold is crossed leading to movement is largely determined by spontaneous subthreshold fluctuations (
              Fig. P1
              ). Because these fluctuations exhibit temporal autocorrelation, time locking to movement onset will ensure that a gradual exponential-looking buildup appears in the average. Thus, two assumptions are required by the model to produce a readiness potential without any immediate intention to move: (
              i
              ) Ongoing fluctuations in neural activity exhibit temporal autocorrelation, and (
              ii
              ) ongoing fluctuations play a role in determining the precise time of movement onset, to which the data epochs are time locked. The former is well known to be the case from prior research (
              5
              ), and the latter is taken up in the present study.
            
            One solution, given these instructions, is to allow intrinsic noise to accumulate in the decision system. Our model for spontaneous movement supposes that subjects shift motor activation up closer to the threshold for initiation of the instructed movement, integrate intrinsic noise, and wait for a random threshold-crossing event. We refer to this as the stochastic-decision model and implement it using a leaky stochastic accumulator process with three parameters.
            
              We propose that, to comply with the instruction to produce spontaneous movements, the brain uses the same mechanism as for any decision-making task: a threshold applied to the output of a neural accumulator (
              4
              ). Decision-making tasks are typically modeled in terms of the accumulation of sensory evidence. What is unique to the spontaneous-movement task is that subjects are specifically instructed to not base their movement decisions on sensory evidence. Subjects are also instructed to not use strategies such as counting (and intentionally varying) time elapsed.
            
            
              In Libet et al.’s (
              3
              ) spontaneous-movement task subjects are asked to make a single “capricious” movement on each trial, without deciding in advance
              when
              the movement will be made—the movement should be maximally “spontaneous.” We refer to the time between the start of the trial and the execution of the movement as the “waiting time.” The questions we pose (and to which we propose an answer) are as follows: (
              i
              ) Why is there a gradual buildup of neuronal activity preceding spontaneous self-initiated movements? And (
              ii
              ) how might this relate to the way the brain generates spontaneous movements in a task like Libet’s?
            
            
              The term
              bereitschaftspotential
              or “readiness potential” ({RP}) refers to a slow 1- to 2-s buildup of scalp electrical potential that reliably precedes self-initiated movements, in the average over many data epochs time locked to movement onset. Discovered in 1965 by Kornhuber and Deecke (
              1
              ), the {RP} has since been linked to changes in neuronal firing rates in the supplementary motor area (
              2
              ) and is widely assumed to reflect an intentional sequence of neural operations directed at producing a movement (
              1
              ). This assumption has become a source of controversy because human subjects appear to be unaware of their intention until only ∼200 ms before the onset of the movement (

We designed a novel training protocol where rats go from naive- to proficient-­level timing performance within a single session, allowing us to investigate neuronal activity from very early learning stages. We used pharmacological experiments and machine-l­earning algorithms to evaluate the level of time encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum. Our results show a double dissociation between the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum during temporal learning, where the former commits to early learning stages while the latter engages as animals become proficient in the task.},

            Atypical habituation and aberrant exploration of novel stimuli have been related to the severity of autism spectrum disorders ({ASDs}), but the underlying neuronal circuits are unknown. Here we show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine ({DA}) neurons of the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) attenuates exploration toward nonfamiliar conspecifics and interferes with the reinforcing properties of nonfamiliar conspecific interaction in mice. Exploration of nonfamiliar stimuli is associated with the insertion of {GluA}2-lacking {AMPA} receptors at excitatory synapses on {VTA} {DA} neurons. These synaptic adaptations persist upon repeated exposure to social stimuli and sustain conspecific interaction. Global or {VTA} {DA} neuron-specific loss of the {ASD}-associated synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin 3 alters the behavioral response toward nonfamiliar conspecifics and the reinforcing properties of conspecific interaction. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by an aberrant expression of {AMPA} receptors and an occlusion of synaptic plasticity. Altogether, these findings link impaired exploration of nonfamiliar conspecifics to {VTA} {DA} neuron dysfunction in mice.},

	abstract = {Somatotopic organization is a fundamental and key concept to understand how the corticobasal ganglia loop works. It is also indispensable knowledge to perform stereotaxic surgery for movement disorders. Here I would like to describe the somatotopic organization of the basal ganglia, which consist of the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. Projections from motor cortical regions representing different body parts terminate in different regions of these nuclei. Basal ganglia neurons respond not only to the stimulation of the corresponding regions of the motor cortices, but also to active and passive movements of the corresponding body parts. On the basis of these anatomical and physiological findings, somatotopic organization can be identified in the motor territories of these nuclei in the basal ganglia. In addition, projections from functionally interrelated cortical areas partially converge through the cortico-basal ganglia loop, but nevertheless the somatotopy is still preserved. Disorganized somatotopy may explain, at least in part, the pathophysiology of movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and dystonia.},

	abstract = {To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We show that the new model has an advantage over conventional reinforcement learning models in a value tracking task, and approaches a theoretic limit of performance provided by the Kalman filter. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. In the proposed network, dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction errors scaled by standard deviation of rewards. We show that such scaling may arise if the striatal neurons learn the standard deviation of rewards and modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons. The model is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.},

Since then, the neuroscientific study of multisensory integration has increased exponentially in both volume and diversity. From initial studies identifying the overlapping receptive fields of multisensory neurons, to subsequent studies of the spatial and temporal principles that govern the integration of multiple sensory cues, our understanding of this phenomenon at the single-neuron level has expanded to include a variety of dimensions. We now can appreciate how multisensory integration can alter patterns of neural activity in time, and even coordinate activity among populations of neurons across different brain areas. There is now a growing battery of sophisticated empirical and computational techniques that are being used to study this process in a number of models. These advancements have not only enhanced our understanding of this remarkable process in the normal adult brain, but also its underlying circuitry, requirements for development, susceptibility to malfunction, and how its principles may be used to mitigate malfunction.},

	abstract = {Many of the mathematical frameworks describing natural selection are equivalent to Bayes’ Theorem, also known as Bayesian updating. By deﬁnition, a process of Bayesian Inference is one which involves a Bayesian update, so we may conclude that these frameworks describe natural selection as a process of Bayesian inference. Thus, natural selection serves as a counter example to a widely-held interpretation that restricts Bayesian Inference to human mental processes (including the endeavors of statisticians). As Bayesian inference can always be cast in terms of (variational) free energy minimization, natural selection can be viewed as comprising two components: a generative model of an “experiment” in the external world environment, and the results of that “experiment” or the “surprise” entailed by predicted and actual outcomes of the “experiment.” Minimization of free energy implies that the implicit measure of “surprise” experienced serves to update the generative model in a Bayesian manner. This description closely accords with the mechanisms of generalized Darwinian process proposed both by Dawkins, in terms of replicators and vehicles, and Campbell, in terms of inferential systems. Bayesian inference is an algorithm for the accumulation of evidence-based knowledge. This algorithm is now seen to operate over a wide range of evolutionary processes, including natural selection, the evolution of mental models and cultural evolutionary processes, notably including science itself. The variational principle of free energy minimization may thus serve as a unifying mathematical framework for universal Darwinism, the study of evolutionary processes operating throughout nature.},

Classical reversal learning tasks mainly measure how well participants can disengage from a previously successful behavior but not how alternative responses are explored. Here, we propose a novel 5-choice reversal learning task with alternating position-reward contingencies to study exploration behavior after a reversal. We compare human exploratory saccade behavior with a prediction obtained from a neuro-computational model of the basal ganglia. A new synaptic plasticity rule for learning the connectivity between the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and external globus pallidus ({GPe}) results in exploration biases to previously rewarded positions. The model simulations and human data both show that during experimental experience exploration becomes limited to only those positions that have been rewarded in the past. Our study demonstrates how quite complex behavior may result from a simple sub-circuit within the basal ganglia pathways.},

	abstract = {In the basal ganglia, focused rhythmicity is an important feature of network activity at certain stages of motor processing. In disease, however, the basal ganglia develop amplified rhythmicity. Here, we demonstrate how the cellular architecture and network dynamics of an inhibitory loop in the basal ganglia yield exaggerated synchrony and locking to β oscillations, specifically in the dopamine-depleted state. A key component of this loop is the pallidostriatal pathway, a well-characterized anatomical projection whose function has long remained obscure. We present a synaptic characterization of this pathway in mice and incorporate these data into a computational model that we use to investigate its influence over striatal activity under simulated healthy and dopamine-depleted conditions. Our model predicts that the pallidostriatal pathway influences striatal output preferentially during periods of synchronized activity within {GPe}. We show that, under dopamine-depleted conditions, this effect becomes a key component of a positive feedback loop between the {GPe} and striatum that promotes synchronization and rhythmicity. Our results generate novel predictions about the role of the pallidostriatal pathway in shaping basal ganglia activity in health and disease.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              This work demonstrates that functional connections from the globus pallidus externa ({GPe}) to striatum are substantially stronger onto fast-spiking interneurons ({FSIs}) than onto medium spiny neurons. Our circuit model suggests that when {GPe} spikes are synchronous, this pallidostriatal pathway causes synchronous {FSI} activity pauses, which allow a transient window of disinhibition for medium spiny neurons. In simulated dopamine-depletion, this {GPe}-{FSI} activity is necessary for the emergence of strong synchronization and the amplification and propagation of β oscillations, which are a hallmark of parkinsonian circuit dysfunction. These results suggest that {GPe} may play a central role in propagating abnormal circuit activity to striatum, which in turn projects to downstream basal ganglia structures. These findings warrant further exploration of {GPe} as a target for interventions for Parkinson's disease.},

The mechanisms underlying these pathological beta oscillations remain elusive. Here, using mathematical models, we find that robust beta oscillations can emerge from inhibitory interactions between striatal medium spiny neurons. The interaction of the synaptic {GABAa} currents and the intrinsic membrane M-current promotes population oscillations in the beta frequency range. Increased levels of cholinergic drive, a condition relevant to the parkinsonian striatum, lead to enhanced beta oscillations in the striatal model. We show experimentally that direct infusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol into the striatum, but not into the neighboring cortex, of the awake, normal rodent induces prominent beta frequency oscillations in the local field potential. These results provide evidence for amplification of normal striatal network dynamics as a mechanism responsible for the enhanced beta frequency oscillations in Parkinson's disease.},

These waves switch between activational motifs and organize dopamine transients into localized clusters within functionally related striatal subregions. Notably, wave trajectories were tailored to task demands, propagating from dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum when rewards are contingent on animal behavior and in the opponent direction when rewards are independent of behavioral responses. We propose a computational architecture in which striatal dopamine waves are sculpted by inference about agency and provide a mechanism to direct credit assignment to specialized striatal subregions. Supporting model predictions, dorsomedial dopamine activity during reward-pursuit signaled the extent of instrumental control and interacted with reward waves to predict future behavioral adjustments.},

In this study, we test the ability for the {AIF} to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-explored—that of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed “neural” {AIF} agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the
              prior mapping function
              that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy/reward. Together, these results demonstrate the use of {AIF} as a plausible model of anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans.},

An embodied agent controlled by such a network inﬂuences and is being inﬂuenced by its environment.

In this article, we combine different methods in order to examine the information ﬂows among and within the body, the brain and the environment of an agent. This allows us to relate various information ﬂows to each other. We test this framework in a simple experimental setup. There, we calculate the optimal policy for goal-directed behavior based on the “planning as inference” method, in which the information-geometric em-algorithm is used to optimize the likelihood of the goal. Morphological computation and integrated information are then calculated with respect to the optimal policies. Comparing the dynamics of these measures under changing morphological circumstances highlights the antagonistic relationship between these two concepts. The more morphological computation is involved, the less information integration within the brain is required. In order to determine the inﬂuence of the brain on the behavior of the agent it is necessary to additionally measure the information ﬂow to and from the brain.},

In one set of experiments (n = 2), we defined the representations of the arm and leg in each cortical motor area by injecting one of the two fluorescent tracers into lower cervical segments (C7-T1) and the other fluorescent tracer into lower lumbosacral segments (L6-S1) of the same animal. In another set of experiments (n = 5), we defined the representations of distal and proximal parts of the forelimb in each cortical motor area by injecting one of the two fluorescent tracers into lower cervical segments (C7-T1) and the other tracer into upper cervical segments (C2-C4) of the same animal. In the primary motor cortex and the {PMd}, cortical regions that project to lower cervical segments were largely separate from those that project to lower lumbosacral segments. In the {PMv}, few neurons were labeled after tracer injections into lower cervical segments or lower lumbosacral segments. However, corticospinal neurons were labeled in the {PMv} after tracer injections into upper cervical segments and after {HRP} placement in the dorsolateral funiculus at T7. The region of the {PMv} that projects to upper cervical segments was separate from that which projects below T7. Cortical regions that project to upper and lower cervical segments of the spinal cord overlapped considerably in the primary motor cortex and in the {PMd}. Despite this overlap, we found that the regions of the primary motor cortex and {PMd} that project most densely to upper cervical segments were largely separate from those that project most densely to lower cervical segments. Furthermore, we found two separate regions within area 4 that send corticospinal projections primarily to the lower cervical segments. One of these regions was located within the classical “hand” area of the primary motor cortex. The other was located at the medial edge of arm representation in the primary motor cortex.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused.

	abstract = {The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” ({MPS}) describes the basic, pre-reﬂective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of {MPS} (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reﬂective bodily processes. The free energy principle ({FEP}; Friston, 2010) is a novel uniﬁed theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the {FEP} via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the {FEP} in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of {MPS} can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the {FEP} and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

We assume that the brain models the world as a hierarchy or cascade of dynamical systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception is equated with the optimization or inversion of these internal models, to explain sensory data. Given a model of how sensory data are generated, we can invoke a generic approach to model inversion, based on a free energy bound on the model's evidence. The ensuing free-energy formulation furnishes equations that prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of neuronal activity that represent the causes of sensory input. Here, we focus on a very general model, whose hierarchical and dynamical structure enables simulated brains to recognize and predict trajectories or sequences of sensory states. We first review hierarchical dynamical models and their inversion. We then show that the brain has the necessary infrastructure to implement this inversion and illustrate this point using synthetic birds that can recognize and categorize birdsongs.},

            Humans and other animals often show a strong desire to know the uncertain rewards their future has in store, even when they cannot use this information to influence the outcome. However, it is unknown how the brain predicts opportunities to gain information and motivates this information-seeking behavior. Here we show that neurons in a network of interconnected subregions of primate anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia predict the moment of gaining information about uncertain rewards. Spontaneous increases in their information prediction signals are followed by gaze shifts toward objects associated with resolving uncertainty, and pharmacologically disrupting this network reduces the motivation to seek information. These findings demonstrate a cortico-basal ganglia mechanism responsible for motivating actions to resolve uncertainty by seeking knowledge about the future.},

In recent years, there has been a flourishing of research into these non-instrumental information preferences and their implementation in the brain. Individuals value information about uncertain future rewards, and do so for multiple reasons, including valuing resolution of uncertainty and overweighting desirable information. The brain motivates this information seeking by tapping into some of the same circuitry as primary rewards like food and water. However, it also employs cortex and basal ganglia circuitry that predicts and values information as distinct from primary reward. Uncovering how these circuits cooperate will be fundamental to understanding information seeking and motivated behavior as a whole, in our increasingly complex and information-rich world.},

These synaptic modifications, in turn, provide the mechanistic underpinning for a specific class of reinforcement learning mechanisms that now seem to underlie much of human and animal behavior.

	abstract = {To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We show that the new model has an advantage over conventional reinforcement learning models in a value tracking task, and approaches a theoretic limit of performance provided by the Kalman filter. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. In the proposed network, dopaminergic neurons encode reward prediction errors scaled by standard deviation of rewards. We show that such scaling may arise if the striatal neurons learn the standard deviation of rewards and modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons. The model is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.},

The standard actor is replaced by a dual opponent actor system representing distinct striatal populations, which come to differentially specialize in discriminating positive and negative action values. Dopamine modulates the degree to which each actor component contributes to both learning and choice discriminations. In contrast to standard frameworks, this model simultaneously captures documented effects of dopamine on both learning and choice incentive—and their interactions—across a variety of studies, including probabilistic {RL}, effort-based choice, and motor skill learning.},

	abstract = {Semantic understanding of unstructured environments plays an essential role in the autonomous planning and execution of whole-body humanoid locomotion and manipulation tasks. We introduce a new graph-based and data-driven method for semantic representation of unknown environments based on visual sensor data streams. The proposed method extends our previous work, in which loco-manipulation scene affordances are detected in a fully unsupervised manner. We build a geometric primitive-based model of the perceived scene and assign interaction possibilities, i.e. affordances, to the individual primitives. The major contribution of this paper is the enrichment of the extracted scene representation with semantic object information through spatio-temporal fusion of primitives during the perception. To this end, we combine the primitive-based scene representation with object detection methods to identify higher semantic structures in the scene. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method in various experiments in simulation and on the humanoid robot {ARMAR}-{III} demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {The thalamus conveys sensory information from peripheral and subcortical regions to the neocortex in a dynamic manner that can be inﬂuenced by several neuromodulators. Alterations in dopamine ({DA}) receptor function in thalami of Schizophrenic patients have recently been reported. In addition, schizophrenia is associated with sensory gating abnormalities and sleep-wake disturbances, thus we examined the role of {DA} on neuronal excitability in somatosensory thalamus. The ventrobasal ({VB}) thalamus receives dopaminergic innervation and expresses {DA} receptors; however, the action of {DA} on {VB} neurons is unknown. In the present study, we performed whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings in rat brain slices to investigate the role of {DA} on excitability of {VB} neurons. We found that {DA} increased action potential discharge and elicited membrane depolarization via activation of different receptor subtypes. Activation of D2-like receptors (D2R) leads to enhanced action potential discharge, whereas the membrane depolarization was mediated by D1like receptors (D1R). The D2R-mediated increase in spike discharge was mimicked and occluded by ␣-dendrotoxin (␣{DTX}), indicating the involvement of a slowly inactivating K؉ channels. The D1R-mediated membrane depolarization was occluded by barium, suggesting the involvement of a G protein– coupled K؉ channel or an inwardly rectifying K؉ channel. Our results indicate that {DA} produces dual modulatory effects acting on subtypes of {DA} receptors in thalamocortical relay neurons, and likely plays a signiﬁcant role in the modulation of sensory information. © 2010 {IBRO}.

	abstract = {Since the early 1970s, numerous behavioral studies have shown that self-generated touch feels less intense and less ticklish than the same touch applied externally. Computational motor control theories have suggested that cerebellar internal models predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements and that these predictions attenuate the perception of the actual touch. Despite this influential theoretical framework, little is known about the neural basis of this predictive attenuation. This is due to the limited number of neuroimaging studies, the presence of conflicting results about the role and the location of cerebellar activity, and the lack of behavioral measures accompanying the neural findings. Here, we combined psychophysics with {fMRI} to detect the neural processes underlying somatosensory attenuation in male and female healthy human participants. Activity in bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was attenuated when the touch was presented during a self-generated movement (self-generated touch) than in the absence of movement (external touch). An additional attenuation effect was observed in the cerebellum that is ipsilateral to the passive limb receiving the touch. Importantly, we further found that the degree of functional connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary and bilateral secondary somatosensory areas was linearly and positively related to the degree of behaviorally assessed attenuation; that is, the more participants perceptually attenuated their self-generated touches, the stronger this corticocerebellar coupling. Collectively, these results suggest that the ipsilateral cerebellum is fundamental in predicting self-generated touch and that this structure implements somatosensory attenuation via its functional connectivity with somatosensory areas.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              When we touch our hand with the other, the resulting sensation feels less intense than when another person or a machine touches our hand with the same intensity. Early computational motor control theories have proposed that the cerebellum predicts and cancels the sensory consequences of our movements; however, the neural correlates of this cancelation remain unknown. By means of {fMRI}, we show that the more participants attenuate the perception of their self-generated touch, the stronger the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the somatosensory cortical areas. This provides conclusive evidence about the role of the cerebellum in predicting the sensory feedback of our movements and in attenuating the associated percepts via its connections to early somatosensory areas.},

Both structures receive input from and send output to the cerebral cortex. Thus, the basal ganglia and cerebellum form multisynaptic loops with the cerebral cortex. Basal ganglia and cerebellar loops have been assumed to be anatomically separate and to perform distinct functional operations. We investigated whether there is any direct route for basal ganglia output to influence cerebellar function that is independent of the cerebral cortex. We injected rabies virus ({RV}) into selected regions of the cerebellar cortex in cebus monkeys and used retrograde transneuronal transport of the virus to determine the origin of multisynaptic inputs to the injection sites. We found that the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia has a substantial disynaptic projection to the cerebellar cortex. This pathway provides a means for both normal and abnormal signals from the basal ganglia to influence cerebellar function. We previously showed that the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum has a disynaptic projection to an input stage of basal ganglia processing, the striatum. Taken together these results provide the anatomical substrate for substantial two-way communication between the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Thus, the two subcortical structures may be linked together to form an integrated functional network.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether the reduction of amplitude of the scalp somatosensory evoked potentials ({SEPs}) during movement (gating) is due to an attenuation of the afferent volley at subcortical level.
Methods: Median nerve {SEPs} were recorded from 9 patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease, who underwent implant of intracerebral ({IC}) electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus or in the globus pallidum. {SEPs} were recorded from Erb’s point ipsilateral to stimulation, from the scalp surface and from the {IC} leads, at rest and during a voluntary ﬂexo-extension movement of the stimulated wrist. The recorded {IC} traces were submitted to an off-line ﬁltering by a 300– 1500 bandpass to obtain the high-frequency {SEP} bursts.
Results: {IC} leads recorded a triphasic component (P1– N1 – P2) from 14 to 22 ms of latency. The amplitudes of the scalp N20, P20 and N30 potentials and of the {IC} triphasic component were signiﬁcantly decreased during movement, while the peripheral N9 amplitude remained unchanged. Also the {IC} bursts, whose frequency was around 1000 Hz, were reduced in amplitude by the voluntary movement.
Conclusions: Since the {IC} triphasic component is probably generated by neurons of the thalamic ventro-postero-lateral nucleus, which receive the somatosensory afferent volley, the P1– N1 amplitude reduction during movement suggests that the gating phenomenon involves also the subcortical structures.},

Receipt of a reward at the expected time allows to compute reward-prediction errors which can drive learning in motor or cognitive structures. Reciprocally, dopamine plays an important role in the timing of external events. Several models of the dopaminergic system exist, but the substrate of temporal learning is rather unclear. In this article, we propose a neuro-computational model of the afferent network to the ventral tegmental area, including the lateral hypothalamus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the ventral basal ganglia (including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral pallidum), as well as the lateral habenula and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. Based on a plausible connectivity and realistic learning rules, this neuro-computational model reproduces several experimental observations, such as the progressive cancelation of dopaminergic bursts at reward delivery, the appearance of bursts at the onset of reward-predicting cues or the inﬂuence of reward magnitude on activity in the amygdala and ventral tegmental area. While associative learning occurs primarily in the amygdala, learning of the temporal relationship between the cue and the associated reward is implemented as a dopamine-modulated coincidence detection mechanism in the nucleus accumbens.},

	abstract = {Notions of mechanism, emergence, reduction and explanation are all tied to levels of analysis. I cover the relationship between lower and higher levels, suggest a level of mechanism approach for neuroscience in which the components of a mechanism can themselves be further decomposed and argue that scientists' goals are best realized by focusing on pragmatic concerns rather than on metaphysical claims about what is ‘real'. Inexplicably, neuroscientists are enchanted by both reduction and emergence. A fascination with reduction is misplaced given that theory is neither sufficiently developed nor formal to allow it, whereas metaphysical claims of emergence bring physicalism into question. Moreover, neuroscience's existence as a discipline is owed to higher-level concepts that prove useful in practice. Claims of biological plausibility are shown to be incoherent from a level of mechanism view and more generally are vacuous. Instead, the relevant findings to address should be specified so that model selection procedures can adjudicate between competing accounts. Model selection can help reduce theoretical confusions and direct empirical investigations. Although measures themselves, such as behaviour, blood-oxygen-level-dependent ({BOLD}) and single-unit recordings, are not levels of analysis, like levels, no measure is fundamental and understanding how measures relate can hasten scientific progress.

	abstract = {Creating autonomous robots that can actively explore the environment, acquire knowledge and learn skills continuously is the ultimate achievement envisioned in cognitive and developmental robotics. Importantly, if the aim is to create robots that can continuously develop through interactions with their environment, their learning processes should be based on interactions with their physical and social world in the manner of human learning and cognitive development. Based on this context, in this paper, we focus on the two concepts of world models and predictive coding. Recently, world models have attracted renewed attention as a topic of considerable interest in artificial intelligence. Cognitive systems learn world models to better predict future sensory observations and optimize their policies, i.e. controllers. Alternatively, in neuroscience, predictive coding proposes that the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics and control behavior in its environment. Both ideas may be considered as underpinning the cognitive development of robots and humans capable of continual or lifelong learning. Although many studies have been conducted on predictive coding in cognitive robotics and neurorobotics, the relationship between world model-based approaches in {AI} and predictive coding in robotics has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore, we outline the frontiers and challenges involved in world models and predictive coding toward the further integration of {AI} and robotics, as well as the creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the future.},

	abstract = {Sensory processing of action effects has been shown to differ from that of externally triggered stimuli, with respect both to the perceived timing of their occurrence (intentional binding) and to their intensity (sensory attenuation). These phenomena are normally attributed to forward action models, such that when action prediction is consistent with changes in our environment, our experience of these effects is altered. Although much progress has been made in recent years in understanding sensory attenuation and intentional binding, a number of important questions regarding the precise nature of the predictive mechanisms involved remain unanswered. Moreover, these mechanisms are often not discussed in empirical papers, and a comprehensive review of these issues is yet to appear. This review attempts to fill this void. We systematically investigated the role of temporal prediction, temporal control, identity prediction, and motor prediction in previous published reports of sensory attenuation and intentional binding. By isolating the individual processes that have previously been contrasted and incorporating these experiments with research in the related fields of temporal attention and stimulus expectation, we assessed the degree to which existing data provide evidence for the role of forward action models in these phenomena. We further propose a number of avenues for future research, which may help to better determine the role of motor prediction in processing of voluntary action effects, as well as to improve understanding of how these phenomena might fit within a general predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our analysis has important implications for understanding disorders of agency in schizophrenia.},

            The brain attenuates its responses to self-produced exteroceptions (e.g., we cannot tickle ourselves). Is this phenomenon, known as sensory attenuation, enabled innately, or acquired through learning? Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural system.},

However, this expanded view of cerebellar processing also raises many new questions about how such apparent diversity of function arises from a structure with striking homogeneity. Hence, this review will highlight both current evidence for predictive cerebellar circuit function that extends beyond the classical view of error-driven supervised learning, as well as open questions that must be addressed to unify our understanding cerebellar circuit function.},

	abstract = {Making predictions and validating the predictions against actual sensory information is thought to be one of the most fundamental functions of the nervous system. A growing body of evidence shows that the neural mechanisms controlling behavior, both in motor and non-motor domains, rely on prediction errors, the discrepancy between predicted and actual information. The cerebellum has been viewed as a key component of the motor system providing predictions about upcoming movements and receiving feedback about motor errors. Consequentially, studies of cerebellar function have focused on the motor domain with less consideration for the wider context in which movements are generated. However, motor learning experiments show that cognition makes important contributions to motor adaptation that involves the cerebellum. One of the more successful theoretical frameworks for understanding motor control and cerebellar function is the forward internal model which states that the cerebellum predicts the sensory consequences of the motor commands and is involved in computing sensory prediction errors by comparing the predictions to the sensory feedback. The forward internal model was applied and tested mainly for effector movements, raising the question whether cerebellar encoding of behavior reﬂects task performance measures associated with cognitive involvement. Electrophysiological studies based on pseudorandom tracking in monkeys show that the discharge of Purkinje cell, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, encodes predictive and feedback signals not only of the effector kinematics but also of task performance. The implications are that the cerebellum implements both effector and task performance forward models and the latter are consistent with the cognitive contributions observed during motor learning. The implications of these ﬁndings include insights into recent psychophysical observations on moving with reduced feedback and motor learning. The ﬁndings also support the cerebellum’s place in hierarchical generative models that work in concert to reﬁne predictions about behavior and the world. Therefore, cerebellar representations bridge motor and non-motor domains and provide a better understanding of cerebellar function within the functional architecture of the brain.},

However, dopamine cells have very low baseline activity, which implies that the representation of these two sorts of error is asymmetric. We explore the implications of this seemingly innocuous asymmetry for the interpretation of dopaminergic firing patterns in experiments with probabilistic rewards which bring about persistent prediction errors. In particular, we show that when averaging the non-stationary prediction errors across trials, a ramping in the activity of the dopamine neurons should be apparent, whose magnitude is dependent on the learning rate. This exact phenomenon was observed in a recent experiment, though being interpreted there in antipodal terms as a within-trial encoding of uncertainty.},

Moreover, graded control can be as fundamental to success as the selection of which action to perform under many naturalistic scenarios: a predator adjusting its speed to intercept moving prey, or a tool-user exerting the perfect amount of force to complete a delicate task. The basal ganglia are a collection of nuclei in vertebrates that extend from the forebrain (telencephalon) to the midbrain (mesencephalon), constituting a major descending extrapyramidal pathway for control over midbrain and brainstem premotor structures.

This so-called center-surround organization is well known in sensory systems, where central signals are facilitated and eccentric signals are inhibited in order to sharpen the contrast between them. There is evidence that this mechanism is relevant to skilled motor behavior, and it is {deWcient}, for example, in the {aVected} primary motor cortex of patients with focal hand dystonia ({FHD}). While it is still not fully elucidated how surround inhibition is generated in healthy subjects, the process is enhanced with handedness and task {diYculty} indicating that it may be an important mechanism for the performance of individuated Wnger movements. In {FHD}, where involuntary overactivation of muscles interferes with precise Wnger movements, a loss of intracortical inhibition likely contributes to the loss of surround inhibition. Several intracortical inhibitory networks are modulated {diVerently} in {FHD} compared with healthy subjects, and these may contribute to the loss of surround inhibition. Surround inhibition can be observed and assessed in the primary motor cortex. It remains unclear, however, if the {eVects} are created in the cortex or if they are derived from, or supported by, motor signals that come from the basal ganglia.},

We studied the neural correlates of body ownership by controlling whether an external object was accepted as part of the body or not. In the rubber hand illusion ({RHI}), correlated visuotactile stimulation causes a fake hand to be perceived as part of one’s own body. In the present study, we distinguished between the causes (i.e., multisensory stimulation) and the effect (i.e., the feeling of ownership) of the {RHI}. Participants watched a right or a left rubber hand being touched either synchronously or asynchronously with respect to their own unseen right hand. A quantiﬁable correlate of the {RHI} is a shift in the perceived position of the subject’s hand toward the rubber hand. We used positron emission tomography to identify brain areas whose activity correlated with this proprioceptive measure of body ownership. Body ownership was related to activity in the right posterior insula and the right frontal operculum. Conversely, when the rubber hand was not attributed to the self, activity was observed in the contralateral parietal cortex, particularly the somatosensory cortex. These structures form a network that plays a fundamental role in linking current sensory stimuli to one’s own body and thus also in self-consciousness.},

	abstract = {The ability to identify and localize our own limbs is crucial for survival. Indeed, the majority of our interactions with objects occur within the space surrounding the hands. In non-human primates, neurons in the posterior parietal and premotor cortices dynamically represent the space near the upper limbs in hand-centered coordinates. Neuronal populations selective for the space near the hand also exist in humans. It is unclear whether these remap the peri-hand representation as the arm is moved in space. Furthermore, no combined neuronal and behavioral data are available about the possible involvement of peri-hand neurons in the perception of the upper limbs in any species. We used {fMRI} adaptation to demonstrate dynamic hand-centered encoding of space by reporting response suppression in human premotor and posterior parietal cortices to repeated presentations of an object near the hand for different arm postures. Furthermore, we show that such spatial representation is related to changes in body perception, being remapped onto a prosthetic hand if perceived as one's own during an illusion. Interestingly, our results further suggest that peri-hand space remapping in the premotor cortex is most tightly linked to the subjective feeling of ownership of the seen limb, whereas remapping in the posterior parietal cortex closely reflects changes in the position sense of the arm. These findings identify the neural bases for dynamic hand-centered encoding of peripersonal space in humans and provide hitherto missing evidence for the link between the peri-hand representation of space and the perceived self-attribution and position of the upper limb.},

              Every student learns that the sensory cortex is used for processing sensation and the motor cortex is used for perceiving movement. However, in the real world, this may not always be so neatly arranged.

              (p.
              1240
              ) have found that sensory and motor fields are specialized for different types of movement, such that in mice the motor cortex controlled the forward movement (protraction) of their whiskers and the sensory cortex controlled backwards movements (retraction) of whiskers. So if a whisker hits an object, then a reasonable first reaction might be a motor command for retraction. Similarly, the motor cortex stimulates protraction for more active exploration. Hence, the sensory cortex is also motor and the motor cortex is also sensory. In an ecological context, these combined reactions offer a repertoire useful for a mouse seeking food and shelter in a complex environment.

            Mouse whisker movements are controlled by both the sensory and motor cortex.
          , 
            Classical studies of mammalian movement control define a prominent role for the primary motor cortex. Investigating the mouse whisker system, we found an additional and equally direct pathway for cortical motor control driven by the primary somatosensory cortex. Whereas activity in primary motor cortex directly evokes exploratory whisker protraction, primary somatosensory cortex directly drives whisker retraction, providing a rapid negative feedback signal for sensorimotor integration. Motor control by sensory cortex suggests the need to reevaluate the functional organization of cortical maps.},

There is a sense indeed in which the term ‘body schema’ is ambiguous, in that it functions as a general term that groups together various body representations intervening at different stages in motor control, representing short- or long-term properties, used for positive or negative affordances. In addition, one might want to distinguish between local body schemata, which represent body parts, and a global body schema, which represents the body as a whole. But is this latter holistic representation really necessary?

Body image refers to a conscious representation of the way the body appears—a set of conscious perceptions, affective attitudes, and beliefs pertaining to one’s own bodily image. In 2005, Shaun Gallagher published an influential book entitled ‘How the Body Shapes the Mind’. This book not only defined both body schema ({BS}) and body image ({BI}), but also explored the complicated relationship between the two. The book also established the idea that there is a double dissociation, whereby body schema and body image refer to two different, but closely related, systems. Given that many kinds of pathological cases can be described in terms of body schema and body image (phantom limbs, asomatognosia, apraxia, schizophrenia, anorexia, depersonalization, and body dysmorphic disorder, among others), we might expect to find a growing consensus about these concepts and the relevant neural activities connected to these systems. Instead, an examination of the scientific literature reveals continued ambiguity and disagreement. This volume brings together leading experts from the fields of philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry in a lively and productive dialogue. It explores fundamental questions about the relationship between body schema and body image, and addresses ongoing debates about the role of the brain and the role of social and cultural factors in our understanding of embodiment.},

Using motion tracking, we sought to elaborate this relationship by characterizing how area 2 activity relates to whole arm movements. We found that a whole-arm model, unlike classic models, successfully predicted how features of neural activity changed as monkeys reached to targets in two workspaces. However, when we then evaluated this whole-arm model across active and passive movements, we found that many neurons did not consistently represent the whole arm over both conditions. These results suggest that 1) neural activity in area 2 includes representation of the whole arm during reaching and 2) many of these neurons represented limb state differently during active and passive movements.},

One way to derive an accurate representation from noisy sensor data is to combine it with the output of a forward model that considers both the previous state estimate and the noisy input. We recorded from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in macaques ( Macaca mulatta) during both active and passive movements to investigate how the proprioceptive representation of movement in S1 may be modified by the motor command (through efference copy). We found neurons in S1 that respond to one or both movement types covering a broad distribution from active movement only, to both, to passive movement only. Those neurons that responded to both active and passive movements responded with similar directional tuning. Confirming earlier results, some, but not all, neurons responded before the onset of volitional movements, possibly as a result of efference copy. Consequently, many of the features necessary to combine the forward model with proprioceptive feedback appear to be present in S1. These features would not be expected from combinations of afferent receptor responses alone.},

	abstract = {The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” ({MPS}) describes the basic, pre-reﬂective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of {MPS} (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reﬂective bodily processes. The free energy principle ({FEP}; Friston, 2010) is a novel uniﬁed theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the {FEP} via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the {FEP} in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of {MPS} can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the {FEP} and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

	abstract = {The human motor system can rapidly adapt its motor output in response to errors. The prevailing theory of this process posits that the motor system adapts an internal forward model that predicts the consequences of outgoing motor commands and uses this forward model to plan future movements. However, despite clear evidence that adaptive forward models exist and are used to help track the state of the body, there is no definitive evidence that such models are used in movement planning. An alternative to the forward-model-based theory of adaptation is that movements are generated based on a learned policy that is adjusted over time by movement errors directly (“direct policy learning”). This learning mechanism could act in parallel with, but independent of, any updates to a predictive forward model. Forward-model-based learning and direct policy learning generate very similar predictions about behavior in conventional adaptation paradigms. However, across three experiments with human participants (
              N
              = 47, 26 female), we show that these mechanisms can be dissociated based on the properties of implicit adaptation under mirror-reversed visual feedback. Although mirror reversal is an extreme perturbation, it still elicits implicit adaptation; however, this adaptation acts to amplify rather than to reduce errors. We show that the pattern of this adaptation over time and across targets is consistent with direct policy learning but not forward-model-based learning. Our findings suggest that the forward-model-based theory of adaptation needs to be re-examined and that direct policy learning provides a more plausible explanation of implicit adaptation.
            
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              The ability of our brain to adapt movements in response to error is one of the most widely studied phenomena in motor learning. Yet, we still do not know the process by which errors eventually result in adaptation. It is known that the brain maintains and updates an internal forward model, which predicts the consequences of motor commands, and the prevailing theory of motor adaptation posits that this updated forward model is responsible for trial-by-trial adaptive changes. Here, we question this view and show instead that adaptation is better explained by a simpler process whereby motor output is directly adjusted by task errors. Our findings cast doubt on long-held beliefs about adaptation.},

In the review that follows, we describe and evaluate recent results from neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and psychophysics in both human and non-human primates that support the existence of an integrated representation of visual, somatosensory, and auditory peripersonal space. Such a representation involves primarily visual, somatosensory, and proprioceptive modalities, operates in body-part-centred reference frames, and demonstrates signiﬁcant plasticity.

            Body schema, a sensorimotor representation of the body used for planning and executing movements, is plastic because it extends by using a tool to reach far objects. Modifications of peripersonal space, i.e., a functional representation of reach space, usually co-occur with body schema changes. Here, we hypothesized that such plastic changes depend on the experience of controlling the course of events in space trough one’s own actions, i.e., the sense of agency. In two experiments, body schema and peripersonal space were assessed before and after the participants’ sense of agency over a virtual hand was manipulated. Body schema and peripersonal space enlarged or contracted depending on whether the virtual hand was presented in far space, or closer to the participants’ body than the real hand. These findings suggest that body schema and peripersonal space are affected by the dynamic mapping between intentional body movements and expected consequences in space.},

            Systematic perturbations in motor adaptation tasks are primarily countered by learning from sensory-prediction errors, with secondary contributions from other learning processes. Despite the availability of these additional processes, particularly the use of explicit re-aiming to counteract observed target errors, patients with cerebellar degeneration are surprisingly unable to compensate for their sensory-prediction error deficits by spontaneously switching to another learning mechanism. We hypothesized that if the nature of the task was changed—by allowing vision of the hand, which eliminates sensory-prediction errors—patients could be induced to preferentially adopt aiming strategies to solve visuomotor rotations. To test this, we first developed a novel visuomotor rotation paradigm that provides participants with vision of their hand in addition to the cursor, effectively setting the sensory-prediction error signal to zero. We demonstrated in younger healthy control subjects that this promotes a switch to strategic re-aiming based on target errors. We then showed that with vision of the hand, patients with cerebellar degeneration could also switch to an aiming strategy in response to visuomotor rotations, performing similarly to age-matched participants (older controls). Moreover, patients could retrieve their learned aiming solution after vision of the hand was removed (although they could not improve beyond what they retrieved), and retain it for at least 1 year. Both patients and older controls, however, exhibited impaired overall adaptation performance compared to younger healthy controls (age 18–33 years), likely due to age-related reductions in spatial and working memory. Patients also failed to generalize, i.e. they were unable to adopt analogous aiming strategies in response to novel rotations. Hence, there appears to be an inescapable obligatory dependence on sensory-prediction error-based learning—even when this system is impaired in patients with cerebellar disease. The persistence of sensory-prediction error-based learning effectively suppresses a switch to target error-based learning, which perhaps explains the unexpectedly poor performance by patients with cerebellar degeneration in visuomotor adaptation tasks.},

Gain modulation is revealed when one input, the modulatory one, affects the gain or the sensitivity of the neuron to the other input, without modifying its selectivity or receptive field properties. This type of modulatory interaction is important for two reasons. First, it is an extremely widespread integration mechanism; it is found in a plethora of cortical areas and in some subcortical structures as well, and as a consequence it seems to play an important role in a striking variety of functions, including eye and limb movements, navigation, spatial perception, attentional processing, and object recognition. Second, there is a theoretical foundation indicating that gain-modulated neurons may serve as a basis for a general class of computations, namely, coordinate transformations and the generation of invariant responses, which indeed may underlie all the brain functions just mentioned. This article describes the relationships between computational models, the physiological properties of a variety of gain-modulated neurons, and some of the behavioral consequences of damage to gain-modulated neural representations.},

It has proven difficult to uncover single-neuron mechanisms that account for neuronal multiplication. Here we show that multiplicative responses can arise in a network model through population effects. Specifically, neurons in a recurrently connected network with excitatory connections between similarly tuned neurons and inhibitory connections between differently tuned neurons can perform a product operation on additive synaptic inputs.

              Macaca mulatta
              ) superior colliculus ({SC}) and the underlying reticular formation is correlated with the initiation and execution of arm movements (Werner, 1993). Although the correlation of this activity with {EMGs} of proximal arm muscles is as strong as in motor cortex (Werner et al., 1997a; Stuphorn et al., 1999), little is known about the influence of electrical microstimulation in the {SC} on the initiation and trajectories of arm movements. Our experiments on three macaque monkeys clearly show that arm movements can be elicited by electrical microstimulation in the deep layers of the lateral {SC} and underlying reticular formation. The most extensively trained monkey, M1, extended his arm toward the screen in front of him more or less stereotypically upon electrical {SC} stimulation. In two other monkeys, M2 and M3, a larger repertoire of arm movements were elicited, categorized into three movement types, and compared before (M3) and after (M2 and M3) training: twitch (56\% vs 62\%), lift (6\% vs 5\%), and extend (37\% vs 32\%), respectively. Therefore, arm movements induced by electrical stimulation in the monkey {SC} represent a further component of the functional repertoire of the {SC} using its impact on motoneurons in the spinal cord, probably via premotor neurons in the brainstem, as well as on structures involved in executing more complex movements such as target-directed reaching. Therefore, the macaque {SC} could be involved directly in the initiation, execution, and amendment of arm and hand movements.},

	abstract = {Actions can be planned in either an intrinsic (body-based) reference frame or an extrinsic (world-based) frame, and understanding how the internal representations associated with these frames contribute to the learning of motor actions is a key issue in motor control. We studied the internal representation of this learning in human subjects by analyzing generalization patterns across an array of different movement directions and workspaces after training a visuomotor rotation in a single movement direction in one workspace. This provided a dense sampling of the generalization function across intrinsic and extrinsic reference frames, which allowed us to dissociate intrinsic and extrinsic representations and determine the manner in which they contributed to the motor memory for a trained action. A first experiment showed that the generalization pattern reflected a memory that was intermediate between intrinsic and extrinsic representations. A second experiment showed that this intermediate representation could not arise from separate intrinsic and extrinsic learning. Instead, we find that the representation of learning is based on a gain-field combination of local representations in intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates. This gain-field representation generalizes between actions by effectively computing similarity based on the (Mahalanobis) distance across intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates and is in line with neural recordings showing mixed intrinsic-extrinsic representations in motor and parietal cortices.},

Here, we demonstrate that the brain may accomplish this by constructing the internal model with primitives multiplicatively encoding information from the kinematics of both arms. We had human participants adapt to a novel force field imposed on one arm while both arms were moving in particular directions and examined the generalization pattern of motor learning when changing the movement directions of both arms. The generalization pattern was consistent with the pattern predicted from the multiplicative encoding scheme. As proposed by previous theoretical studies, the strength of multiplicative encoding was manifested in the observation that participants could adapt reaching movements to complicated force fields depending nonlinearly on the movement directions of both arms. These results indicate that multiplicative neuronal influence of the kinematics of the opposing arm on the internal models enables the brain to control bimanual movement by providing great flexible ability to handle arbitrary dynamical environments resulting from the interactions of both arms.},

The striatum also receives dopaminergic inputs that can signal reward prediction errors and also behavioral transitions and movement initiation. Here we review studies and models of how direct and indirect pathways can modulate basal ganglia outputs to facilitate movement initiation, and we discuss the role of cortical and dopaminergic inputs to the striatum in determining what to do and if and when to do it.

Furthermore, similarity between different actions corresponded to the similarity between {SPN} ensemble patterns, irrespective of movement speed. Consistently, the accuracy of decoding behavior from {SPN} ensemble patterns was directly related to the dissimilarity between behavioral clusters.

To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data.

            Accurate motor control depends on maps of the body in the brain, called the body schema. Disorders of the body schema cause motor deficits. Although we often execute actions with different motor systems such as the eye and hand, how the body schema operates during such actions is unknown. In this study, participants simultaneously directed eye and hand movements to the same body part. These two movements were found to be guided by different body maps. This finding demonstrates multiple motor system–specific representations of the body schema, suggesting that the choice of motor system toward one’s body can determine which of the brain’s body maps is observed.

          , 
            Purposeful motor actions depend on the brain’s representation of the body, called the body schema, and disorders of the body schema have been reported to show motor deficits. The body schema has been assumed for almost a century to be a common body representation supporting all types of motor actions, and previous studies have considered only a single motor action. Although we often execute multiple motor actions, how the body schema operates during such actions is unknown. To address this issue, I developed a technique to measure the body schema during multiple motor actions. Participants made simultaneous eye and reach movements to the same location of 10 landmarks on their hand. By analyzing the internal configuration of the locations of these points for each of the eye and reach movements, I produced maps of the mental representation of hand shape. Despite these two movements being simultaneously directed to the same bodily location, the resulting hand map (i.e., a part of the body schema) was much more distorted for reach movements than for eye movements. Furthermore, the weighting of visual and proprioceptive bodily cues to build up this part of the body schema differed for each effector. These results demonstrate that the body schema is organized as multiple effector-specific body representations. I propose that the choice of effector toward one’s body can determine which body representation in the brain is observed and that this visualization approach may offer a new way to understand patients’ body schema.},

In the review that follows, we describe and evaluate recent results from neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and psychophysics in both human and non-human primates that support the existence of an integrated representation of visual, somatosensory, and auditory peripersonal space. Such a representation involves primarily visual, somatosensory, and proprioceptive modalities, operates in body-part-centred reference frames, and demonstrates signiﬁcant plasticity. Recent research shows that the use of tools, the viewing of one’s body or body parts in mirrors, and in video monitors, may also modulate the visuotactile representation of peripersonal space.},

This dopamine proﬁle is speciﬁc to behavioral choice, scalable with interval duration, and doesn’t reﬂect reward prediction error, timing, or value as single factors alone. Genetic deletion of {NMDA} receptors on dopamine or striatal neurons or optogenetic manipulation of dopamine concentration alters dopamine signaling and biases action selection.

Furthermore, lesioning the {DLS} prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors.

	abstract = {The striatum integrates excitatory inputs from the cortex and the thalamus to control diverse functions. Although the striatum is thought to consist of sensorimotor, associative and limbic domains, their precise demarcations and whether additional functional subdivisions exist remain unclear. How striatal inputs are differentially segregated into each domain is also poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive map of the excitatory inputs to the mouse striatum. The input patterns reveal boundaries between the known striatal domains. The most posterior striatum likely represents the 4th functional subdivision, and the dorsomedial striatum integrates highly heterogeneous, multimodal inputs. The complete thalamo-cortico-striatal loop is also presented, which reveals that the thalamic subregions innervated by the basal ganglia preferentially interconnect with motor-related cortical areas. Optogenetic experiments show the subregion-specific heterogeneity in the synaptic properties of striatal inputs from both the cortex and the thalamus. This projectome will guide functional studies investigating diverse striatal functions.
          , 
            To fully understand how the brain works, we need to understand how different brain structures are organized and how information flows between these structures. For example, the cortex and thalamus communicate with another structure known as the basal ganglia, which is essential for controlling voluntary movement, emotions and reward behaviour in humans and other mammals. Information from the cortex and the thalamus enters the basal ganglia at an area called the striatum. This area is further divided into smaller functional regions known as domains that sort sensorimotor, emotion and executive information into the basal ganglia to control different types of behaviour. Three such domains have been identified in the striatum of mice. However, the boundaries between these domains are vague and it is not clear whether any other domains exist or if the domains can actually be divided into even smaller areas with more precise roles.
            Information entering the striatum from other parts of the brain can either stimulate activity in the striatum (known as an “excitatory input”) or alter existing excitatory inputs. Now, Hunnicutt et al. present the first comprehensive map of excitatory inputs into the striatum of mice. The experiments show that while many of the excitatory inputs flowing into the striatum from the cortex and thalamus are sorted into the three known domains, a unique combination of the excitatory inputs are sorted into a new domain instead. One of the original three domains of the striatum is known to relay information related to associative learning, for example, linking an emotion to a person or place. Hunnicutt et al. show that this domain has a more complex architecture than the other domains, being made up of many distinct areas. This complexity may help it to process the various types of information required to make such associations.
            The findings of Hunnicutt et al. provide a framework for understanding how the striatum works in healthy and diseased brains. Since faulty information processing in the striatum is a direct cause of Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and other neurological disorders in humans, this framework may aid the development of new treatments for these disorders.},

            The striatum shows general topographic organization and regional differences in behavioral functions. How corticostriatal topography differs across cortical areas and cell types to support these distinct functions is unclear. This study contrasted corticostriatal projections from two layer 5 cell types, intratelencephalic ({IT}-type) and pyramidal tract ({PT}-type) neurons, using viral vectors expressing fluorescent reporters in Cre-driver mice. Corticostriatal projections from sensory and motor cortex are somatotopic, with a decreasing topographic specificity as injection sites move from sensory to motor and frontal areas. Topographic organization differs between {IT}-type and {PT}-type neurons, including injections in the same site, with {IT}-type neurons having higher topographic stereotypy than {PT}-type neurons. Furthermore, {IT}-type projections from interconnected cortical areas have stronger correlations in corticostriatal targeting than {PT}-type projections do. As predicted by a longstanding model, corticostriatal projections of interconnected cortical areas form parallel circuits in the basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisﬁes its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artiﬁcial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.},

However, dopamine cells have very low baseline activity, which implies that the representation of these two sorts of error is asymmetric. We explore the implications of this seemingly innocuous asymmetry for the interpretation of dopaminergic firing patterns in experiments with probabilistic rewards which bring about persistent prediction errors. In particular, we show that when averaging the non-stationary prediction errors across trials, a ramping in the activity of the dopamine neurons should be apparent, whose magnitude is dependent on the learning rate. This exact phenomenon was observed in a recent experiment, though being interpreted there in antipodal terms as a within-trial encoding of uncertainty.},

In macaque ventral premotor cortex, we recorded the activity of neurons that responded to both visual and tactile stimuli. For these bimodal cells, the visual receptive field extended from the tactile receptive field into the adjacent space. Their tactile receptive fields were organized topographically, with the arms represented medially, the face represented in the middle, and the inside of the mouth represented laterally. For many neurons, both the visual and tactile responses were directionally selective, although many neurons also responded to stationary stimuli. In the awake monkeys, for 70\% of bimodal neurons with a tactile response on the arm, the visual receptive field moved when the arm was moved. In contrast, for 0\% the visual receptive field moved when the eye or head moved. Thus the visual receptive fields of most “arm + visual” cells were anchored to the arm, not to the eye or head. In the anesthetized monkey, the effect of arm position was similar. For 95\% of bimodal neurons with a tactile response on the face, the visual receptive field moved as the head was rotated. In contrast, for 15\% the visual receptive field moved with the eye and for 0\% it moved with the arm. Thus the visual receptive fields of most “face + visual” cells were anchored to the head, not to the eye or arm. To construct a visual receptive field anchored to the arm, it is necessary to integrate the position of the arm, head, and eye. For arm + visual cells, the spontaneous activity, the magnitude of the visual response, and sometimes both were modulated by the position of the arm (37\%), the head (75\%), and the eye (58\%). In contrast, to construct a visual receptive field that is anchored to the head, it is necessary to use the position of the eye, but not of the head or the arm. For face + visual cells, the spontaneous activity and/or response magnitude was modulated by the position of the eyes (88\%), but not of the head or the arm (0\%). Visual receptive fields anchored to the arm can encode stimulus location in “arm-centered” coordinates, and would be useful for guiding arm movements. Visual receptive fields anchored to the head can likewise encode stimuli in “head-centered” coordinates, useful for guiding head movements. Sixty-three percent of face + visual neurons responded during voluntary movements of the head. We suggest that “body-part-centered” coordinates provide a general solution to a problem of sensory-motor integration: sensory stimuli are located in a coordinate system anchored to a particular body part.},

Results show similar drifting patterns in both human and robot experiments, and they also suggest that the perceptual drift is due to prediction error fusion, rather than hypothesis selection.

In the dominant model of the function of the {BG} and their role in Parkinson’s disease, direct ({dSPNs}) and indirect ({iSPNs}) striatal projection neurons are proposed to oppositely modulate cortical activity via {BG} outputs to thalamus. Here, we test this model by determining how striatal activity modulates primary motor cortex in awake head-restrained mice. We ﬁnd that, within 200 ms, {dSPN} and {iSPN} activation exert robust and opposite effects on the majority of cortical neurons. However, these effects are heterogeneous, with certain cortical neurons biphasically modulated by {iSPN} stimulation. Moreover, these striatal effects are diminished when the animal performs a motor action. Thus, the effects of {dSPN} and {iSPN} activity on cortex are at times antagonistic, consistent with classic models, whereas in other contexts these effects can be occluded or coactive.},

In this striatal model, neuronal population activity is assumed to encode locomotion relevant information. Here, we propose a novel encoding mechanism for the dorsal striatum. We identiﬁed spatially compact neural clusters in both the direct and indirect pathways. Detailed characterization revealed similar cluster organization between the direct and indirect pathways, and cluster activities from both pathways were correlated with mouse locomotion velocities. Using machine-learning algorithms, cluster activities could be used to decode locomotion relevant behavioral states and locomotion velocity. We propose that neural clusters in the dorsal striatum encode locomotion relevant information and that coordinated activities of direct and indirect pathway neural clusters are required for normal striatal controlled behavior.},

Two basal ganglia pathways have been classically hypothesized to regulate this process via opposing roles in movement facilitation and suppression. By using a series of state-dependent optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the contributions of each pathway and found that both the direct striatonigral pathway and the indirect striatopallidal pathway are necessary for smooth initiation and the execution of learned action sequences. Optogenetic inhibition or stimulation of each pathway before sequence initiation increased the latency for initiation: manipulations of the striatonigral pathway activity slowed action initiation, and those of the striatopallidal pathway aborted action initiation. The inhibition of each pathway after initiation also impaired ongoing execution. Furthermore, the subtle activation of striatonigral neurons sustained the performance of learned sequences, while striatopallidal manipulations aborted ongoing performance. These results suggest a supportive versus permissive model, where patterns of coordinated activity, rather than the relative amount of activity in these pathways, regulate movement initiation and execution.},

	abstract = {For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the ﬁeld of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent ﬁndings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.},

These phenomena are usually regarded as errors in processes of trans-saccadic spatial transformations and they provide important tools to study these processes. However, a true understanding of the underlying brain processes that participate in the preparation for a saccade and in the transfer of information across it requires a closer, more quantitative approach that links different perceptual phenomena with each other and with the functional requirements of ensuring spatial stability. We review a number of computational models of peri-saccadic spatial perception that provide steps in that direction. Although most models are concerned with only specific phenomena, some generalization and interconnection between them can be obtained from a comparison. Our analysis shows how different perceptual effects can coherently be brought together and linked back to neuronal mechanisms on the way to explaining vision across saccades.},

	abstract = {Spatial perception, the localization of stimuli in space, can rely on visual reference stimuli or on egocentric factors such as a stimulus position relative to eye gaze. In total darkness, only an egocentric reference frame provides sufficient information. When stimuli are briefly flashed around saccades, the localization error reveals potential mechanisms of updating such reference frames as described in several theories and computational models. Recent novel experimental evidence, however, showed that the maximum amount of mislocalization does not scale linearly with saccade amplitude but rather stays below 13° even for long saccades, which is different from predicted by present models. We propose a new model of perisaccadic mislocalization in complete darkness to account for this observation. According to this model, mislocalization arises not on the motor side by comparing a retinal position signal with an extraretinal eye position related signal but by updating stimulus position in visual areas through a combination of proprioceptive eye position and corollary discharge. Simulations with realistic input signals and temporal dynamics show that both signals together are used for spatial updating and in turn bring about perisaccadic mislocalization.},

	abstract = {Predictive processing ({PP}) approaches to the mind are increasingly popular in the cognitive sciences. This surge of interest is accompanied by a proliferation of philosophical arguments, which seek to either extend or oppose various aspects of the emerging framework. In particular, the question of how to position predictive processing with respect to enactive and embodied cognition has become a topic of intense debate. While these arguments are certainly of valuable scientiﬁc and philosophical merit, they risk underestimating the variety of approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here, we ﬁrst present a basic review of neuroscientiﬁc, cognitive, and philosophical approaches to {PP}, to illustrate how these range from solidly cognitivist applications—with a ﬁrm commitment to modular, internalistic mental representation—to more moderate views emphasizing the importance of ‘bodyrepresentations’, and ﬁnally to those which ﬁt comfortably with radically enactive, embodied, and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive processing theory (e.g., of attention or consciousness) must take into account this continuum of views, and associated theoretical commitments. As a ﬁnal point, we illustrate how the Free Energy Principle ({FEP}) attempts to dissolve tension between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition, by providing a formal synthetic account of how internal ‘representations’ arise from autopoietic self-organization. The {FEP} thus furnishes empirically productive process theories (e.g., predictive processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal modelling of the embodied mind.},

	abstract = {The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” ({MPS}) describes the basic, pre-reﬂective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of {MPS} (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reﬂective bodily processes. The free energy principle ({FEP}; Friston, 2010) is a novel uniﬁed theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the {FEP} via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the {FEP} in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of {MPS} can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the {FEP} and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

First, functional imaging during a serial order recall task was used to study human brain activity during the selection of sequential actions from working memory. Second, microelectrode recordings from monkeys trained in a step-tracking task were used to study the natural selection of corrective submovements. Our {DPM}-based model assisted in the interpretation of puzzling data from both of these experiments. We come to posit that the many loops through the basal ganglia each regulate the embodiment of pattern formation in a given area of cerebral cortex. This operation serves to instantiate different kinds of action (or thought) mediated by different areas of cerebral cortex. We then use our findings to formulate a model of the aetiology of schizophrenia.},

However, this theory cannot solve the credit assignment problem of processing a global movement evaluation into multiple cell-specific error signals. We identify a possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create eligibility traces and signal error changes guiding plasticity. Error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors ({SGDEGE}), predicts synaptic plasticity rules that apparently contradict the current consensus but were supported by plasticity experiments in slices from mice under conditions designed to be physiological, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to experimental conditions. We analyse the algorithm’s convergence and capacity. Finally, we suggest {SGDEGE} may also operate in the basal ganglia.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13018},
	abstract = {Biological and artificial information processing systems form representations of the world that they can use to categorize, reason, plan, navigate, and make decisions. How can we measure the extent to which the representations formed by these diverse systems agree? Do similarities in representations then translate into similar behavior? And if so, then how can a system’s representations be modified to better match those of another system? These questions pertaining to the study of representational alignment are at the heart of some of the most active research areas in contemporary cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. For example, cognitive scientists seek to measure the representational alignment of multiple individuals to identify shared cognitive priors, neuroscientists seek to align {fMRI} responses from multiple individuals into a shared representational space to boost the signal for group-level analyses, and machine learning researchers seek to distill knowledge from large teacher models into small student models by increasing their representational alignment. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge transfer between research communities interested in representational alignment, so progress in one field often ends up being rediscovered independently in another. Thus, greater cross-field communication would be advantageous. To improve communication between fields, we propose a unifying framework that can serve as a common language between researchers studying representational alignment. We survey the literature from the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning, and demonstrate how prior work fits into this framework. Finally, we lay out open problems in representational alignment where progress can benefit all three of these fields. We hope that our work can catalyze cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress for all communities studying and developing information processing systems. We note that this is a working paper and encourage readers to reach out with their suggestions for future revisions.},

            Learning about the world is critical to survival and success. In social animals, learning about others is a necessary component of navigating the social world, ultimately contributing to increasing evolutionary fitness. How humans and nonhuman animals represent the internal states and experiences of others has long been a subject of intense interest in the developmental psychology tradition, and, more recently, in studies of learning and decision making involving self and other. In this review, we explore how psychology conceptualizes the process of representing others, and how neuroscience has uncovered correlates of reinforcement learning signals to explore the neural mechanisms underlying social learning from the perspective of representing reward-related information about self and other. In particular, we discuss self-referenced and other-referenced types of reward prediction errors across multiple brain structures that effectively allow reinforcement learning algorithms to mediate social learning. Prediction-based computational principles in the brain may be strikingly conserved between self-referenced and other-referenced information.},

In addition to photoentrainment, they mediate the effects of light experience as a central modulator of mood, learning, and health [2]. This makes a complete account of the circuity responsible for {ipRGCs}’ light responses essential to understanding their diverse roles in our well-being. Considerable progress has been made in understanding {ipRGCs}’ melanopsinmediated responses in rodents [3–5]. However, in primates, {ipRGCs} also have a rare blue-{OFF} response mediated by an unknown short-wavelength-sensitive (S)-cone circuit [6]. Identifying this S-cone circuit is particularly important because {ipRGCs} mediate many of the wide-ranging effects of short-wavelength light on human biology. These effects are often attributed to melanopsin, but there is evidence for an S-cone contribution as well [7, 8]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the S-{OFF} response is mediated by the S-{ON} pathway through inhibitory input from an undiscovered S-cone amacrine cell. Using serial electron microscopy in the macaque retina, we reconstructed the neurons and synapses of the Scone connectome, revealing a novel inhibitory interneuron, an amacrine cell, receiving excitatory glutamatergic input exclusively from S-{ON} bipolar cells. This S-cone amacrine cell makes highly selective inhibitory synapses onto {ipRGCs}, resulting in a blue-{OFF} response. Identiﬁcation of the S-cone amacrine cell provides the missing component of an evolutionarily ancient circuit using spectral information for non-image forming visual functions.},

	abstract = {How is color represented by spatially distributed patterns of activity in visual cortex? Functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to several stimulus colors were analyzed with multivariate techniques: conventional pattern classification, a forward model of idealized color tuning, and principal component analysis ({PCA}). Stimulus color was accurately decoded from activity in V1, V2, V3, V4, and {VO}1 but not {LO}1, {LO}2, V3A/B, or {MT}+. The conventional classifier and forward model yielded similar accuracies, but the forward model (unlike the classifier) also reliably reconstructed novel stimulus colors not used to train (specify parameters of) the model. The mean responses, averaged across voxels in each visual area, were not reliably distinguishable for the different stimulus colors. Hence, each stimulus color was associated with a unique spatially distributed pattern of activity, presumably reflecting the color selectivity of cortical neurons. Using {PCA}, a color space was derived from the covariation, across voxels, in the responses to different colors. In V4 and {VO}1, the first two principal component scores (main source of variation) of the responses revealed a progression through perceptual color space, with perceptually similar colors evoking the most similar responses. This was not the case for any of the other visual cortical areas, including V1, although decoding was most accurate in V1. This dissociation implies a transformation from the color representation in V1 to reflect perceptual color space in V4 and {VO}1.},

	abstract = {We address the question of color-space interactions in the brain, by proposing a neural field model of color perception with spatial context for the visual area V1 of the cortex. Our framework reconciles two opposing perceptual phenomena, known as simultaneous contrast and chromatic assimilation. They have been previously shown to act synergistically, so that at some point in an image, the color seems perceptually more similar to that of adjacent neighbors, while being more dissimilar from that of remote ones. Thus, their combined effects are enhanced in the presence of a spatial pattern, and can be measured as larger shifts in color matching experiments. Our model supposes a hypercolumnar structure coding for colors in V1, and relies on the notion of color opponency introduced by Hering. The connectivity kernel of the neural field exploits the balance between attraction and repulsion in color and physical spaces, so as to reproduce the sign reversal in the influence of neighboring points. The color sensation at a point, defined from a steady state of the neural activities, is then extracted as a nonlinear percept conveyed by an assembly of neurons. It connects the cortical and perceptual levels, because we describe the search for a color match in asymmetric matching experiments as a mathematical projection on color sensations. We validate our color neural field alongside this color matching framework, by performing a multi-parameter regression to data produced by psychophysicists and ourselves. All the results show that we are able to explain the nonlinear behavior of shifts observed along one or two dimensions in color space, which cannot be done using a simple linear model.},

	abstract = {Color processing begins with the absorption of light by cone photoreceptors, and progresses through a series of hierarchical stages: Retinal signals carrying color information are transmitted through the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus ({LGN}) up to the primary visual cortex (V1). From V1, the signals are processed by the second visual area (V2); then by cells located in subcompartments (“globs”) within the posterior inferior temporal ({PIT}) cortex, a brain region that encompasses area V4 and brain regions immediately anterior to V4. Color signals are then processed by regions deep within the inferior temporal ({IT}) cortex including area {TE}. As a heuristic, one can consider each of these stages to be involved in constructing a distinct aspect of the color percept. The three cone types are the basis for trichromacy; retinal ganglion cells that respond in an opponent fashion to activation of different cone classes are the basis for color opponency (these “cone-opponent” cells increase their firing rate above baseline to activation of one cone class and decrease their firing rate below baseline to activation of a different cone class); double-opponent neurons in the V1 generate local color contrast and are the building blocks for color constancy; glob cells elaborate the perception of hue; and {IT} integrates color perception in the context of behavior. Finally, though nothing is known, these signals presumably interface with motor programs and emotional centers of the brain to mediate the widely acknowledged emotional salience of color.},

Under neutral-adapting conditions, we mapped the cone inputs (L, M, and S) to 83 cone-opponent cells representing the central visual field of the next stage of visual processing, primary visual cortex (V1), to determine how the color signals are spatially transformed. Cone-opponent cells, constituting ∼10\% of V1 cells, formed two populations, red–green (L vs M; 66 of 83) and blue–yellow (S vs L+M; 17 of 83). Many cone-opponent cells (48 of 83) were double-opponent, with circular receptive-field centers and crescent-shaped surrounds (0.63° offset) that had opposite chromatic tuning to the centers and a time-to-peak 11 ms later than the centers. The remaining cone-opponent cells were either spatially opponent in only one cone system (20 of 83) or lacked spatial opponency (15 of 83). Cells lacking spatial opponency had smaller receptive fields (0.5–0.7°) than spatial-opponent cell centers (∼1°). We found that red–green cells received S-cone input, which aligned with M input, and, unlike blue–yellow cells, red–green cells gave push–pull responses: receptive-field centers of red-{ON} cells were excited by both L increments (bright red) and M decrements (dark red) and were suppressed by both L decrements (dark green) and M increments (bright green). Excitatory responses to decrements were slightly larger than to increments, which may account for the lower detection and discrimination thresholds of decrements shown psychophysically. By virtue of their specialized receptive fields, the neurons described here spatially transform the cone signals and represent the first stage in the visual system at which spatially opponent color calculations are made.},

Here, spots of light that selectively modulate one class of cones (L, M, or S, or loosely red, green, or blue) were flashed in and around the receptive fields of V-1 color cells to map the spatial structure of the cone inputs. The maps generated using these cone-isolating stimuli and an eye-position-corrected reverse correlation technique produced four findings. First, the receptive fields were Double-Opponent, an organization of spatial and chromatic opponency critical for color constancy and color contrast. Optimally stimulating both center and surround subregions with adjacent red and green spots excited the cells more than stimulating a single subregion. Second, red–green cells responded in a luminance-invariant way. For example, red-on-center cells were excited equally by a stimulus that increased L-cone activity (appearing bright red) and by a stimulus that decreased M-cone activity (appearing dark red). This implies that the opponency between L and M is balanced and argues that these cells are encoding a single chromatic axis. Third, most color cells responded to stimuli of all orientations and had circularly symmetric receptive fields. Some cells, however, showed a coarse orientation preference. This was reflected in the receptive fields as oriented Double-Opponent subregions. Fourth, red–green cells often responded to S-cone stimuli. Responses to M- and S-cone stimuli usually aligned, suggesting that these cells might be red–cyan. In summary, red–green (or red–cyan) cells, along with blue–yellow and black–white cells, establish three chromatic axes that are sufficient to describe all of color space.},

Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, {PITd}, and posterior {TEO} that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased {fMRI} hotspots that we call ‘‘globs,’’ each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity.

Cells in ‘‘interglob’’ regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective.

The sequence of transforms involved in constructing perceptions of colour can be approximated by colour appearance models such as the {CIE} (2002) colour appearance model, abbreviated as {CIECAM}02. In this study, we test the plausibility of {CIECAM}02 as a model of colour processing by looking for evidence of its cortical entrainment. The {CIECAM}02 model predicts that colour is split in to two opposing chromatic components, red-green and cyan-yellow (termed {CIECAM}02-a and {CIECAM}02-b respectively), and an achromatic component (termed {CIECAM}02-A). Entrainment of cortical activity to the outputs of these components was estimated using measurements of electro- and magnetoencephalographic ({EMEG}) activity, recorded while healthy subjects watched videos of dots changing colour. We ﬁnd entrainment to chromatic component {CIECAM}02-a at approximately 35 ms latency bilaterally in occipital lobe regions, and entrainment to achromatic component {CIECAM}02-A at approximately 75 ms latency, also bilaterally in occipital regions. For comparison, transforms from a less physiologically plausible model ({CIELAB}) were also tested, with no signiﬁcant entrainment found.},

Here we use a Representational Similarity Analysis ({RSA}) of {fMRI}-{BOLD} signals to make quantitative comparisons across {LGN} and multiple visual areas of the low-level stimulus information encoded in the patterns of voxel responses. Our stimulus set was picked to target the four functionally distinct subcortical channels that input visual cortex from the {LGN}: two achromatic sinewave stimuli that favor the responses of the high-temporal magnocellular and high-spatial parvocellular pathways, respectively, and two chromatic stimuli isolating the L/M-cone opponent and S-cone opponent pathways, respectively. Each stimulus type had three spatial extents to sample both foveal and para-central visual ﬁeld. With the {RSA}, we compare quantitatively the response specializations for individual stimuli and combinations of stimuli in each area and how these change across visual cortex. First, our results replicate the known response preferences for motion/ﬂicker in the dorsal visual areas. In addition, we identify two distinct gradients along the ventral visual stream. In the early visual areas (V1–V3), the strongest differential representation is for the achromatic high spatial frequency stimuli, suitable for form vision, and a very weak differentiation of chromatic versus achromatic contrast. Emerging in ventral occipital areas (V4, {VO}1 and {VO}2), however, is an increasingly strong separation of the responses to chromatic versus achromatic contrast and a decline in the high spatial frequency representation. These gradients provide new insight into how visual information is transformed across the visual cortex.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Color vision starts with the absorption of light in the retinal cone photoreceptors, which transduce electromagnetic energy into electrical voltages. These voltages are transformed into action potentials by a complicated network of cells in the retina. The information is sent to the visual cortex via the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) in three separate color-opponent channels that have been characterized psychophysically, physiologically, and computationally. The properties of cells in the retina and {LGN} account for a surprisingly large body of psychophysical literature. This suggests that several fundamental computations involved in color perception occur at early levels of processing. In the cortex, information from the three retino-geniculate channels is combined to enable perception of a large variety of different hues. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that color analysis and coding cannot be separated from the analysis and coding of other visual attributes such as form and motion. Though there are some brain areas that are more sensitive to color than others, color vision emerges through the combined activity of neurons in many different areas.},

The model explains the diversity of orientation selectivity with neuron-to-neuron variability in all three mechanisms, of which variability in the orientation bandwidth of linear ﬁltering is the most important. The model also accounts for the cells’ diversity of spatial frequency selectivity. Tuning diversity is matched to the needs of visual encoding. The orientation content found in natural scenes is diverse, and neurons with different selectivities are adapted to different stimulus conﬁgurations. Single orientations are better encoded by highly selective neurons, while orientation mixtures are better encoded by less selective neurons. A diverse population of neurons therefore provides better overall discrimination capabilities for natural images than any homogeneous population.},

We show that any color activates 1–4 separate cortical patches within “globs,” millimeter-sized color-preferring modules. Most patches belong to different hue or lightness clusters, in which sequential representations follow the color order in {HSL} space. Some patches overlap greatly with those of related colors, forming stacks, possibly representing invariable features, whereas few seem positioned irregularly. However, for any color, saturation increases the activity of all its patches. These results reveal how the color map in V4 is organized along the framework of the perceptual {HSL} space, whereupon different multipatch activity patterns represent different colors. We propose that such distributed and combinatorial representations may expand the encodable color space of small cortical maps and facilitate binding color information to other image features.},

Here, observers attended concurrently to two out of four fully overlapping random dot kinematograms of different colours, and the allocation of attention to each colour was assessed separately by recordings of steady-state visual evoked potentials. The magnitude of attention effects depended on colour proximity and was well described by a simple model which suggested that colour space is rescaled in an adaptive manner to achieve attentional selection. In conclusion, different spatially overlaid colours can be attended concurrently with an efﬁciency that is determined by their conﬁguration in colour space, supporting the idea that (at least in terms of hue) colour acts as a single dimension for attentional purposes.},

            There is still much to understand about the brain’s colour processing mechanisms and the transformation from cone-opponent representations to perceptual hues. Moreover, it is unclear which area(s) in the brain represent unique hues. We propose a hierarchical model inspired by the neuronal mechanisms in the brain for local hue representation, which reveals the contributions of each visual cortical area in hue representation. Hue encoding is achieved through incrementally increasing processing nonlinearities beginning with cone input. Besides employing nonlinear rectifications, we propose multiplicative modulations as a form of nonlinearity. Our simulation results indicate that multiplicative modulations have significant contributions in encoding of hues along intermediate directions in the {MacLeod}-Boynton diagram and that our model V2 neurons have the capacity to encode unique hues. Additionally, responses of our model neurons resemble those of biological colour cells, suggesting that our model provides a novel formulation of the brain’s colour processing pathway.},

The binding problem appears to be due to the distributed nature of visual processing in the primate brain, and the gradual loss of spatial information along the processing hierarchy. The model relies on the reentrant connections so ubiquitous in the primate brain to recover spatial information, and thus allows features represented in diﬀerent parts of the brain to be integrated in a unitary conscious percept. We demonstrate the ability of the Selective Tuning model of visual attention [1] to recover spatial information, and based on this we propose a general solution to the feature binding problem. The solution is used to simulate the results of a recent neurophysiology study on the binding of motion and color. The example demonstrates how the method is able to handle the diﬃcult case of transparency.},

A key issue is whether there are modular pathways that respond selectively to colour or whether there are common neural substrates for both colour and achromatic (Ach) contrast. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) adaptation to investigate the responses of early and extrastriate visual areas to colour and Ach contrast. High-contrast red–green ({RG}) and Ach sinewave rings (0.5 cycles/degree, 2 Hz) were used as both adapting stimuli and test stimuli in a block design. We found robust adaptation to {RG} or Ach contrast in all visual areas. Cross-adaptation between {RG} and Ach contrast occurred in all areas indicating the presence of integrated, colour and Ach responses. Notably, we revealed contrasting trends for the two test stimuli. For the {RG} test, unselective processing (robust adaptation to both {RG} and Ach contrast) was most evident in the early visual areas (V1 and V2), but selective responses, revealed as greater adaptation between the same stimuli than cross-adaptation between different stimuli, emerged in the ventral cortex, in V4 and {VO} in particular. For the Ach test, unselective responses were again most evident in early visual areas but Ach selectivity emerged in the dorsal cortex (V3a and {hMT}+). Our ﬁndings support a strong presence of integrated mechanisms for colour and Ach contrast across the visual hierarchy, with a progression towards selective processing in extrastriate visual areas.},

	abstract = {We discovered in slices of rat visual cortex that reliable long-term potentiation ({LTP}) of synaptic responses in layer {III} could be elicited by theta burst stimulation delivered to a site in the middle of the cortical thickness, corresponding mainly to layer {IV}. This synaptic plasticity was reflected in the extracellular field potentials and intracellular {EPSPs} in layer {III}, but was not observed in the intracellular responses of layer V neurons, suggesting a preferential involvement of synapses on layer {III} neurons. Tetanus-induced {LTP} in this preparation was input specific, and was blocked by application of an {NMDA} receptor antagonist (but not by an antagonist of nitric oxide synthase). In addition, {LTP} of layer {IV}-evoked responses could also be produced reliably by pairing low-frequency synaptic stimulation (approximately 100 pulses at 1 Hz) with strong intracellular depolarization of layer {III} neurons. Thus, {LTP} in this circuit satisfies the definition of a “Hebbian” modification. Tetanic stimulation of the white matter, in sharp contrast, consistently failed to elicit {LTP} in layer {III} unless a {GABAA} receptor antagonist was applied to the slice. Analysis indicated that the critical difference between layer {IV} and white matter stimulation was not the magnitude of the responses to single stimuli delivered to the two sites, but that it might lie in the postsynaptic response during high-frequency stimulation. Consistent with this idea, “associative” {LTP} could be elicited from white matter when converging but independent inputs from the white matter and layer {IV} simultaneously received tetanic conditioning stimulation. A hypothetical model is presented to account for the differences between layer {IV} and white matter stimulation. According to this “plasticity gate hypothesis,” inhibitory circuitry in layer {IV} normally acts as a sort of band-pass filter that constrains the types of activity patterns that can gain access to the modifiable synapses in layer {III}. By stimulating in layer {IV}, we have bypassed this filter and therefore do not need to block {GABAA} receptors to achieve the threshold for {LTP} in layer {III}.},

	abstract = {In the inferior temporal ({IT}) cortex of monkeys, which has been shown to play a critical role in colour discrimination, there are neurons sensitive to a narrow range of hues and saturation. By contrast, neurons in the retina and the parvocellular layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus ({pLGN}) encode colours in a way that does not provide explicit representation of hue or saturation, and the process by which hue- and saturation-selectivity is elaborated remains unknown. We therefore tested the colour-selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and compared it with those of {pLGN} and {IT} neurons. Quantitative analysis was performed using a standard set of colours, systematically distributed within the {CIE} (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage)-xy chromaticity diagram. Selectivity for hue and saturation was characterized by analysing response contours re¯ecting the overall distribution of responses across the chromaticity diagram. We found that the response contours of almost all {pLGN} neurons were linear and broadly tuned for hue. Many V1 neurons behaved similarly; nonetheless, a considerable number of V1 neurons had clearly curved response contours and were selective for a narrow range of hues or saturation. The relative frequencies of neurons exhibiting various selectivities for hue and saturation were remarkably similar in the V1 and {IT} cortex, but were clearly different in the {pLGN}. Thus, V1 apparently plays a very important role in the conversion of colour signals necessary for generating the elaborate colour selectivity observed in the {IT} cortex.},

	abstract = {In primate retina, “red-green” color coding is initiated when signals originating in long (L) and middle (M) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors interact antagonistically. The center-surround receptive field of “midget” ganglion cells provides the neural substrate for L versus M cone-opponent interaction, but the underlying circuitry remains unsettled, centering around the longstanding question of whether specialized cone wiring is present. To address this question, we measured the strength, sign, and spatial tuning of L- and M-cone input to midget receptive fields in the peripheral retina of macaque primates of either sex. Consistent with previous work, cone opponency arose when one of the cone types showed a stronger connection to the receptive field center than to the surround. We implemented a difference-of-Gaussians spatial receptive field model, incorporating known biology of the midget circuit, to test whether physiological responses we observed in real cells could be captured entirely by anatomical nonselectivity. When this model sampled nonselectively from a realistic cone mosaic, it accurately reproduced key features of a cone-opponent receptive field structure, and predicted both the variability and strength of cone opponency across the retina. The model introduced here is consistent with abundant anatomical evidence for nonselective wiring, explains both local and global properties of the midget population, and supports a role in their multiplexing of spatial and color information. It provides a neural basis for human chromatic sensitivity across the visual field, as well as the maintenance of normal color vision despite significant variability in the relative number of L and M cones across individuals.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Red-green color vision is a hallmark of the human and nonhuman primate that starts in the retina with the presence of long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptor types. Understanding the underlying retinal mechanism for color opponency has focused on the broad question of whether this characteristic can emerge from nonselective wiring, or whether complex cone-type-specific wiring must be invoked. We provide experimental and modeling support for the hypothesis that nonselective connectivity is sufficient to produce the range of red-green color opponency observed in midget ganglion cells across the retina. Our nonselective model reproduces the diversity of physiological responses of midget cells while also accounting for systematic changes in color sensitivity across the visual field.},

Also, the role of the primary visual cortex, V1, in color processing now seems much larger than it did in 1985. The re-evaluation of the important role of V1 in color vision was caused in part by investigations of human V1 responses to color, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, {fMRI}, and in part by the results of numerous studies of single-unit neurophysiology in nonhuman primates. The neurophysiological results have highlighted the importance of double-opponent cells in V1.

	abstract = {Large islands of extrastriate cortex that are enriched for color-tuned neurons have recently been described in alert macaque using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and single-unit recording. These millimeter-sized islands, dubbed “globs,” are scattered throughout the posterior inferior temporal cortex ({PIT}), a swath of brain anterior to area V3, including areas V4, {PITd}, and posterior {TEO}. We investigated the micro-organization of neurons within the globs. We used {fMRI} to identify the globs and then used {MRI}-guided microelectrodes to test the color properties of single glob cells. We used color stimuli that sample the {CIELUV} perceptual color space at regular intervals to test the color tuning of single units, and make two observations. First, color-tuned neurons of various color preferences were found within single globs. Second, adjacent glob cells tended to have the same color tuning, demonstrating that glob cells are clustered by color preference and suggesting that they are arranged in color columns. Neurons separated by 50 μm, measured parallel to the cortical sheet, had more similar color tuning than neurons separated by 100 μm, suggesting that the scale of the color columns is {\textless}100 μm. These results show that color-tuned neurons in {PIT} are organized by color preference on a finer scale than the scale of single globs. Moreover, the color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along a given electrode penetration shifted gradually in many penetrations, suggesting that the color columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map reflecting perceptual color space.},

However, with recent demands on crossmedia colour reproduction, e.g., to match the appearance of a colour or an image on a display to that on hard copy paper, conventional colorimetry is becoming insufﬁcient. It requires a colour appearance model capable of predicting colour appearance across a wide range of viewing conditions so that colour appearance modelling becomes the third stage of colorimetry. Some call this as advanced colorimetry. This chapter will focused on the recent developments based on {CIECAM}02.},

We find that the {QCM} explains the same, cross-validated variance as a conventional general linear model, with far fewer free parameters. The {QCM} generalizes to allow prediction of V1 responses to a large range of modulations. We replicate the results for each subject and find good agreement across both replications and subjects. We find that within the {LM} cone contrast plane, V1 is most sensitive to L-M contrast modulations and least sensitive to L+M contrast modulations.

A useful cue for the detection of object boundaries is the superposition of luminance and color edges. To gain insight into the suitability of this cue for object recognition, we examined convolutional neural network models that had been trained to recognize objects in natural images. We focused specifically on units in the second convolutional layer whose activations are invariant to the spatial phase of a sinusoidal grating. Some of these units were tuned for a nonlinear combination of color and luminance, which is broadly consistent with a role in object boundary detection. Others were tuned for luminance alone, but very few were tuned for color alone. A literature review reveals that V1 complex cells have a similar distribution of tuning. We speculate that this pattern of sensitivity provides an efficient basis for object recognition, perhaps by mitigating the effects of lighting on luminance contrast polarity. The absence of a contrast polarity-invariant representation of color alone suggests that it is redundant with other representations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Neurons are often probed by presenting a set of stimuli that vary along one dimension (e.g. color) and quantifying how this stimulus property affect neural activity. An open question, in particular where higher-level areas are involved, is how much tuning measured with one stimulus set reveals about tuning to a new set. Here we ask this question by estimating tuning to hue in macaque V4 from a set of natural scenes and a set of simple color stimuli. We found that hue tuning was strong in each dataset but was not correlated across the datasets, a finding expected if neurons have strong mixed selectivity. We also show how such mixed selectivity may be useful for transmitting information about multiple dimensions of the world. Our finding suggest that tuning in higher visual areas measured with simple stimuli may thus not generalize to naturalistic stimuli.
          
            New \& Noteworthy
            Visual cortex is often investigated by mapping neural tuning to variables selected by the researcher such as color. How much does this approach tell us a neuron’s general ‘role’ in vision? Here we show that for strongly hue-tuned neurons in V4, estimating hue tuning from artificial stimuli does not reveal the hue tuning in the context of natural scenes. We show how models of optimal information processing suggest that such mixed selectivity maximizes information transmission.},

After detailing the evolution of network activity through analytical and numerical approaches, we discuss the effects of the model’s cortical parameters on the selectivity of the tuning curves. In particular, we explore the role of the model’s thresholding nonlinearity in enhancing hue selectivity by expanding the region of stability, allowing for the precise encoding of chromatic stimuli in early vision. Finally, in the absence of a stimulus, the model is capable of explaining hallucinatory color perception via a Turing-like mechanism of biological pattern formation.},

Also, the role of the primary visual cortex, V1, in color processing now seems much larger than it did in 1985. The re-evaluation of the important role of V1 in color vision was caused in part by investigations of human V1 responses to color, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, {fMRI}, and in part by the results of numerous studies of single-unit neurophysiology in nonhuman primates. The neurophysiological results have highlighted the importance of double-opponent cells in V1.

	abstract = {We discovered in slices of rat visual cortex that reliable long-term potentiation ({LTP}) of synaptic responses in layer {III} could be elicited by theta burst stimulation delivered to a site in the middle of the cortical thickness, corresponding mainly to layer {IV}. This synaptic plasticity was reflected in the extracellular field potentials and intracellular {EPSPs} in layer {III}, but was not observed in the intracellular responses of layer V neurons, suggesting a preferential involvement of synapses on layer {III} neurons. Tetanus-induced {LTP} in this preparation was input specific, and was blocked by application of an {NMDA} receptor antagonist (but not by an antagonist of nitric oxide synthase). In addition, {LTP} of layer {IV}-evoked responses could also be produced reliably by pairing low-frequency synaptic stimulation (approximately 100 pulses at 1 Hz) with strong intracellular depolarization of layer {III} neurons. Thus, {LTP} in this circuit satisfies the definition of a “Hebbian” modification. Tetanic stimulation of the white matter, in sharp contrast, consistently failed to elicit {LTP} in layer {III} unless a {GABAA} receptor antagonist was applied to the slice. Analysis indicated that the critical difference between layer {IV} and white matter stimulation was not the magnitude of the responses to single stimuli delivered to the two sites, but that it might lie in the postsynaptic response during high-frequency stimulation. Consistent with this idea, “associative” {LTP} could be elicited from white matter when converging but independent inputs from the white matter and layer {IV} simultaneously received tetanic conditioning stimulation. A hypothetical model is presented to account for the differences between layer {IV} and white matter stimulation. According to this “plasticity gate hypothesis,” inhibitory circuitry in layer {IV} normally acts as a sort of band-pass filter that constrains the types of activity patterns that can gain access to the modifiable synapses in layer {III}. By stimulating in layer {IV}, we have bypassed this filter and therefore do not need to block {GABAA} receptors to achieve the threshold for {LTP} in layer {III}.},

	abstract = {In the inferior temporal ({IT}) cortex of monkeys, which has been shown to play a critical role in colour discrimination, there are neurons sensitive to a narrow range of hues and saturation. By contrast, neurons in the retina and the parvocellular layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus ({pLGN}) encode colours in a way that does not provide explicit representation of hue or saturation, and the process by which hue- and saturation-selectivity is elaborated remains unknown. We therefore tested the colour-selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and compared it with those of {pLGN} and {IT} neurons. Quantitative analysis was performed using a standard set of colours, systematically distributed within the {CIE} (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage)-xy chromaticity diagram. Selectivity for hue and saturation was characterized by analysing response contours re¯ecting the overall distribution of responses across the chromaticity diagram. We found that the response contours of almost all {pLGN} neurons were linear and broadly tuned for hue. Many V1 neurons behaved similarly; nonetheless, a considerable number of V1 neurons had clearly curved response contours and were selective for a narrow range of hues or saturation. The relative frequencies of neurons exhibiting various selectivities for hue and saturation were remarkably similar in the V1 and {IT} cortex, but were clearly different in the {pLGN}. Thus, V1 apparently plays a very important role in the conversion of colour signals necessary for generating the elaborate colour selectivity observed in the {IT} cortex.},

	abstract = {In primate retina, “red-green” color coding is initiated when signals originating in long (L) and middle (M) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors interact antagonistically. The center-surround receptive field of “midget” ganglion cells provides the neural substrate for L versus M cone-opponent interaction, but the underlying circuitry remains unsettled, centering around the longstanding question of whether specialized cone wiring is present. To address this question, we measured the strength, sign, and spatial tuning of L- and M-cone input to midget receptive fields in the peripheral retina of macaque primates of either sex. Consistent with previous work, cone opponency arose when one of the cone types showed a stronger connection to the receptive field center than to the surround. We implemented a difference-of-Gaussians spatial receptive field model, incorporating known biology of the midget circuit, to test whether physiological responses we observed in real cells could be captured entirely by anatomical nonselectivity. When this model sampled nonselectively from a realistic cone mosaic, it accurately reproduced key features of a cone-opponent receptive field structure, and predicted both the variability and strength of cone opponency across the retina. The model introduced here is consistent with abundant anatomical evidence for nonselective wiring, explains both local and global properties of the midget population, and supports a role in their multiplexing of spatial and color information. It provides a neural basis for human chromatic sensitivity across the visual field, as well as the maintenance of normal color vision despite significant variability in the relative number of L and M cones across individuals.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Red-green color vision is a hallmark of the human and nonhuman primate that starts in the retina with the presence of long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptor types. Understanding the underlying retinal mechanism for color opponency has focused on the broad question of whether this characteristic can emerge from nonselective wiring, or whether complex cone-type-specific wiring must be invoked. We provide experimental and modeling support for the hypothesis that nonselective connectivity is sufficient to produce the range of red-green color opponency observed in midget ganglion cells across the retina. Our nonselective model reproduces the diversity of physiological responses of midget cells while also accounting for systematic changes in color sensitivity across the visual field.},

Also, the role of the primary visual cortex, V1, in color processing now seems much larger than it did in 1985. The re-evaluation of the important role of V1 in color vision was caused in part by investigations of human V1 responses to color, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, {fMRI}, and in part by the results of numerous studies of single-unit neurophysiology in nonhuman primates. The neurophysiological results have highlighted the importance of double-opponent cells in V1. Another new concept is population coding of hue, saturation, and brightness in cortical neuronal population activity.},

These millimeter-sized islands, dubbed “globs,” are scattered throughout the posterior inferior temporal cortex ({PIT}), a swath of brain anterior to area V3, including areas V4, {PITd}, and posterior {TEO}. We investigated the micro-organization of neurons within the globs. We used {fMRI} to identify the globs and then used {MRI}-guided microelectrodes to test the color properties of single glob cells. We used color stimuli that sample the {CIELUV} perceptual color space at regular intervals to test the color tuning of single units, and make two observations. First, color-tuned neurons of various color preferences were found within single globs. Second, adjacent glob cells tended to have the same color tuning, demonstrating that glob cells are clustered by color preference and suggesting that they are arranged in color columns. Neurons separated by 50 μm, measured parallel to the cortical sheet, had more similar color tuning than neurons separated by 100 μm, suggesting that the scale of the color columns is {\textless}100 μm. These results show that color-tuned neurons in {PIT} are organized by color preference on a finer scale than the scale of single globs. Moreover, the color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along a given electrode penetration shifted gradually in many penetrations, suggesting that the color columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map reflecting perceptual color space.},

Controversy has particularly surrounded one aspect of color's encoding in the visual system—opponent processing in primary visual cortex. Early single-unit studies suggested that V1 contains relatively few color-opponent neurons. Neuroimaging measurements, however, have suggested that such neurons might be relatively numerous. Here, we reconcile these apparently discrepant results and conclude that V1 contains relatively large numbers of color-opponent neurons. We first review results from each method and find that most neuroimaging studies provide evidence of substantial color opponency in V1, and that despite apparent controversy, most single-unit studies agree that relatively large numbers of V1 neurons show some sort of color opponency. To reconcile the results from different techniques more formally, we used electrophysiological data to predict the outcomes of neuroimaging experiments. We simulated the expected {fMRI} response in V1 to spatial patterns of different color, based on the neurons’ properties, as reported in Johnson, Hawken, and Shapley, (2001). The simulated responses to stimuli used in Engel, Zhang, and Wandell, (1997) agree well with the actually observed {fMRI} results. The model identifies several factors that led to the apparent discrepancy between techniques, and makes testable predictions about how these factors influence the magnitude of color-opponent signals. {fMRI} and single-unit data converge to show that large numbers of color-opponent neurons exist in V1.},

However, with recent demands on crossmedia colour reproduction, e.g., to match the appearance of a colour or an image on a display to that on hard copy paper, conventional colorimetry is becoming insufﬁcient. It requires a colour appearance model capable of predicting colour appearance across a wide range of viewing conditions so that colour appearance modelling becomes the third stage of colorimetry.

            Reservoir computing, a new method of machine learning, has recently been used to predict the state evolution of various chaotic dynamic systems. It has significant advantages in terms of training cost and adjusted parameters; however, the prediction length is limited. For classic reservoir computing, the prediction length can only reach five to six Lyapunov times. Here, we modified the method of reservoir computing by adding feedback, continuous or discrete, to “calibrate” the input of the reservoir and then reconstruct the entire dynamic systems. The reconstruction length appreciably increased and the training length obviously decreased. The reconstructing of dynamical systems is studied in detail under this method. The reconstruction can be significantly improved both in length and accuracy. Additionally, we summarized the effect of different kinds of input feedback. The more it interacts with others in dynamical equations, the better the reconstructions. Nonlinear terms can reveal more information than linear terms once the interaction terms are equal. This method has proven effective via several classical chaotic systems. It can be superior to traditional reservoir computing in reconstruction, provides new hints in computing promotion, and may be used in some real applications.},

Individuals with cerebellar ataxia exhibit impaired learning in visuomotor adaptation tasks such as prism adaptation and force field learning. Both types of tasks involve the adjustment of an internal model to compensate for an external perturbation. This updating process is error driven, with the error signal based on the difference between anticipated and actual sensory information. This process may entail a credit assignment problem, with a distinction made between error arising from faulty representation of the environment and error arising from noise in the controller. We hypothesized that people with ataxia may perform poorly at visuomotor adaptation because they attribute a greater proportion of their error to their motor control difficulties. We tested this hypothesis using a computational model based on a Kalman filter. We imposed a 20-deg visuomotor rotation in either a single large step or in a series of smaller 5-deg steps. The ataxic group exhibited a comparable deficit in both conditions. The computational analyses indicate that the patients' deficit cannot be accounted for simply by their increased motor variability. Rather, the patients' deficit in learning may be related to difficulty in estimating the instability in the environment or variability in their motor system.},

	abstract = {The human motor system rapidly adapts to systematic perturbations but the adapted behavior seems to be forgotten equally rapidly. The reason for this forgetting is unclear, as is how to overcome it to promote long-term learning. Here we show that adapted behavior can be stabilized by a period of binary feedback about success and failure in the absence of vector error feedback. We examined the time course of decay after adaptation to a visuomotor rotation through a visual error-clamp condition—trials in which subjects received false visual feedback showing perfect directional performance, regardless of the movements they actually made. Exposure to this error-clamp following initial visuomotor adaptation led to a rapid reversion to baseline behavior. In contrast, exposure to binary feedback after initial adaptation turned the adapted state into a new baseline, to which subjects reverted after transient exposure to another visuomotor rotation. When both binary feedback and vector error were present, some subjects exhibited rapid decay to the original baseline, while others persisted in the new baseline. We propose that learning can be decomposed into two components—a fast-learning, fast-forgetting adaptation process that is sensitive to vector errors and insensitive to task success, and a second process driven by success that learns more slowly but is less susceptible to forgetting. These two learning systems may be recruited to different degrees across individuals. Understanding this competitive balance and exploiting the long-term retention properties of learning through reinforcement is likely to be essential for successful neuro-rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Visuomotor adaptation is often driven by error-based ({EB}) learning in which signed errors update motor commands. There are, however, visuomotor tasks where signed errors are unavailable or cannot be mapped onto appropriate motor command changes, rendering {EB} learning ineffective; and yet, healthy subjects can learn in these {EB} learning-free conditions. While {EB} learning depends on cerebellar integrity, the neural bases of {EB}-independent learning are poorly understood. As basal ganglia are involved in learning mechanisms that are independent of signed error feedback, here we tested whether patients with basal ganglia lesions, including those with Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, would show impairments in a visuomotor learning task that prevents the use of {EB} learning. We employed two visuomotor throwing tasks that were similar, but were profoundly different in the resulting visual feedback. This difference was implemented through the introduction of either a lateral displacement of the visual ﬁeld via a wedge prism ({EB} learning) or a horizontal reversal of the visual ﬁeld via a dove prism (non-{EB} learning). Our results show that patients with basal ganglia degeneration had normal {EB} learning in the wedge prism task, but were profoundly impaired in the reversing prism task that does not depend on the signed error signal feedback. These results represent the ﬁrst evidence that human visuomotor learning in the absence of {EB} feedback depends on the integrity of the basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the basal ganglia ({BG}) play a key role in action selection and reinforcement learning. However, despite considerable number of studies, the {BG} architecture and function are not completely understood. Action selection and reinforcement learning are facilitated by the activity of dopaminergic neurons, which encode reward prediction errors when reward outcomes are higher or lower than expected. The {BG} are thought to select proper motor responses by gating appropriate actions, and suppressing inappropriate ones. The direct striato-nigral ({GO}) and the indirect striato-pallidal ({NOGO}) pathways have been suggested to provide the functions of {BG} in the two-pathway concept. Previous models conﬁrmed the idea that these two pathways can mediate the behavioral choice, but only for a relatively small number of potential behaviors. Recent studies have provided new evidence of {BG} involvement in motor adaptation tasks, in which adaptation occurs in a non-error-based manner. In such tasks, there is a continuum of possible actions, each represented by a complex neuronal activity pattern. We extended the classical concept of the two-pathway {BG} by creating a model of {BG} interacting with a movement execution system, which allows for an arbitrary number of possible actions. The model includes sensory and premotor cortices, {BG}, a spinal cord network, and a virtual mechanical arm performing 2D reaching movements. The arm is composed of 2 joints (shoulder and elbow) controlled by 6 muscles (4 mono-articular and 2 bi-articular). The spinal cord network contains motoneurons, controlling the muscles, and sensory interneurons that receive afferent feedback and mediate basic reﬂexes. Given a speciﬁc goal-oriented motor task, the {BG} network through reinforcement learning constructs a behavior from an arbitrary number of basic actions represented by cortical activity patterns. Our study conﬁrms that, with slight modiﬁcations, the classical two-pathway {BG} concept is consistent with results of previous studies, including non-error based motor adaptation experiments, pharmacological manipulations with {BG} nuclei, and functional deﬁcits observed in {BG}-related motor disorders.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

We show that if stochastic variations in the dynamics of local microcircuits are correlated with signals related to functional improvements of the brain (e.g. in the control of behavior), the computational operation of these microcircuits can become optimized for speciﬁc tasks such as the generation of speciﬁc periodic signals and task-dependent routing of information. Furthermore, we show that working memory can autonomously emerge through reward-modulated Hebbian learning, if needed for speciﬁc tasks. Altogether, our results suggest that reward-modulated synaptic plasticity can not only optimize the network parameters for speciﬁc computational tasks, but also initiate a functional rewiring that re-programs microcircuits, thereby generating diverse computational functions in different generic cortical microcircuits. On a more general level, this work provides a new perspective for a standard model for computations in generic cortical microcircuits (liquid computing model). It shows that the arguably most problematic assumption of this model, the postulate of a teacher that trains neural readouts through supervised learning, can be eliminated. We show that generic networks of neurons can learn numerous biologically relevant computations through trial and error.},

Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than generally appreciated.},

We found that the frequency of discharge of 63.9\% of the cells studied was a multilinear function of the position of the hand in space according to the following equation (multiple linear regression): d = f + fxsx + fysy + fzsz, where d is the discharge rate of a single cell, f, fx, fy, fz are regression coefficients, and sx, sy, sz are the coordinates of the position of the hand. The equation above defines a positional gradient which implies that the frequency of cell discharge will increase at a maximum rate when the position of the hand changes along a certain direction; we call this direction of orientation of the positional gradient, and the rate of change in discharge rate along this orientation, the magnitude of the gradient. The orientations of the positional gradients were distributed throughout three-dimensional (3-D) space and their magnitudes differed among different cells. In a different experiment, we studied the changes in activity of 289 cells in the arm area of the motor cortex when the monkeys made equal- amplitude movements that started from different points in space, were in the same direction, and traveled along parallel trajectories in 3-D space. Four pairs of such movement directions (i.e., a total of 8 movement directions) were studied for every cell, and the changes in cell activity associated with movements within each pair were compared. We found that these changes in cell activity did not differ statistically for 68.4\% of the movement pairs studied but did differ for the remaining 31.6\%. The data from the whole population of cells studied in this experiment were analyzed using the population vector analysis described in the preceding paper (Georgopoulos et al., 1988). Thus, 8 population vectors were calculated, 1 for each of the 8 movement directions studied. We found that the direction of the population vector was close to the direction of the corresponding movement. These results indicate that the population vector provides unique information concerning the direction of the movement even when the point of origin of the movement varies in 3-D space.},

In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them.

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model ({SCM}) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and uniﬁes other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the eﬀects of potential interventions, (also called “causal eﬀects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of eﬀects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect eﬀects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper deﬁnes the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

Existing theoretical models still lack satisfying computational explanations from connectionist perspectives, especially for how the brain encodes body perception and generates illusions from neuronal interactions. Moreover, the integration of disability experiments is also neglected. Here, we integrate biological ﬁndings of bodily self-consciousness to propose a brain-inspired bodily self-perception model by which perceptions of bodily self are autonomously constructed without any supervision signals. We successfully validated the model with six {RHI} experiments and a disability experiment on an {iCub} humanoid robot and simulated environments. The results show that our model can not only well-replicate the behavioral and neural data of monkeys in biological experiments but also reasonably explain the causes and results of {RHI} at the neuronal level, thus contributing to the revelation of mechanisms underlying {RHI}.},

While our subjective experiences of these qualities do not submit to measurement, physiological conditions that are required to perceive colours of a constant hue can be identiﬁed. For instance, a constant ratio of responses of different types of opponent cells in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus of primates may serve as a neurophysiological correlate of a constant hue. This is, however, not the correlate for seeing a particular hue quality, say unique red. This latter correlate, if it exists as a separable entity, must be associated with yet unidentiﬁed, higher-level neural activities.

            Studies of color perception have led to mechanistic models of how cone-opponent signals from retinal ganglion cells are integrated to generate color appearance. But it is unknown how this hypothesized integration occurs in the brain. Here we show that cone-opponent signals transmitted from retina to primary visual cortex (V1) are integrated through highly organized circuits within V1 to implement the color opponent interactions required for color appearance. Combining intrinsic signal optical imaging ({ISI}) and 2-photon calcium imaging (2PCI) at single cell resolution, we demonstrate cone-opponent functional domains ({COFDs}) that combine L/M cone-opponent and S/L + M cone-opponent signals following the rules predicted from psychophysical studies of color perception. These give rise to an orderly organization of hue preferences of the neurons within the {COFDs} and the generation of hue “pinwheels”. Thus, spatially organized neural circuits mediate an orderly transition from cone-opponency to color appearance that begins in V1.},

	abstract = {Recently the state space models ({SSMs}) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon {SSMs} is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for {SSMs} due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On {ImageNet} classification, {COCO} object detection, and {ADE}20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like {DeiT}, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation \& memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster than {DeiT} and saves 86.8\% {GPU} memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248\${\textbackslash}times\$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation \& memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

	abstract = {In visual search, the internal representation of the target feature is referred to as the attentional template. The attentional template can be broad or precise depending on the task requirements. In singleton search, the attentional template is broad because the target is the only colored element in the display. In feature search, a precise attentional template is required because the target is in a specific color in an array of varied colors. To measure the precision of the attentional template, we used a cue-target paradigm where cueing benefits decrease when the cue color differs from the target color. Consistent with broad and precise attentional templates, the decrease of cueing effects was stronger in feature than in singleton search. Measurements of {ERPs} showed that the N2pc elicited by the cue decreased with increasing color difference, suggesting that attention was more strongly captured by cues that were similar to the target. However, the cue-elicited N2pc did not differ between feature and singleton search, making it unlikely to reflect the mechanism underlying attentional template precision. Furthermore, there was no evidence for attentional suppression as there was no cue-elicited P
              D
              , even in conditions where the cueing benefit turned into a same-location cost. However, an index of signal enhancement, the contralateral positivity, reflected attention template precision. In general, there was sensory enhancement of the stimulus appearing at the cued location in the search display. With broad attentional templates, any stimulus at the cued location was enhanced, whereas enhancement was restricted to target-matching colors with precise attentional templates.},

Theeuwes (2004, Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 11(1), 65–70) argued that attentional capture depends on the size of the attentional window. If the attentional window is large, search is efficient and attentional capture should be stronger because the distractor is more likely to be inside the window. Consistently, we found higher search efficiency and more attentional capture in singleton than in feature search. However, differences in attentional capture only occurred when singleton and feature search were performed by different groups of participants, but not when singleton and feature search occurred unpredictably in the same group of participants. This result contradicts the attentional window account because search efficiency was always higher in singleton than in feature search. Rather, the results support search mode theory, which claims that participants looked for the most salient stimulus in singleton search (“singleton detection mode”), which resulted in more capture by the salient color distractor. When search types varied unpredictably, it was impossible to apply a consistent search strategy, which eliminated the differences between singleton and feature search. Further, we manipulated search efficiency by target–nontarget similarity. With dissimilar nontargets, the target was salient and search efficiency was high. Therefore, the attentional window account predicts more capture. However, we found the opposite result in singleton search and no difference in feature search. Taken together, these observations are inconsistent with the attentional window account but support search mode theory.},

	abstract = {Attentional templates are representations of target features in working memory ({WM}). Although two attentional templates can guide visual search in dual-target search, search efﬁciency is reduced compared with one attentional template in single-target search. Here, we investigated whether the allocation of {WM} resources contributes to these differences. Participants always memorized two colors, but the use of the corresponding {WM} representations varied. In the blocked conditions, the two colors were either maintained as attentional templates for dual-target search or as simple {WM} representations for recall only. In the mixed condition, one color was maintained as an attentional template for single-target search and the other as a simple {WM} representation for recall only. Reaction times ({RTs}) were delayed and recall precision reduced with two attentional templates in the blocked condition compared with one attentional template in the mixed condition, indicating that search efﬁciency and {WM} resources decreased in dual- compared with single-target search. Moreover, the attentional template was always recalled more precisely than the simple {WM} representation in the mixed condition, despite lowered visual search frequency (Experiment 2) and retro-cueing (Experiment 3). Consistent with the existence of an “active” {WM} state, resources were strongly biased toward the attentional template in single-target search. In dual-target search, however, resources were balanced between two attentional templates and ﬂexibly adjusted with retro-cues, as with two simple {WM} representations. Therefore, the allocation of {WM} resources goes beyond the traditional dichotomy between “active” and “accessory” {WM} states and explains how attentional templates guide visual search with variable efﬁciency.},

Machine learning techniques have recently emerged that allow us to create networks of model neurons that display behaviors of similar complexity. Here we demonstrate the direct applicability of one such technique, the {FORCE} method, to spiking neural networks. We train these networks to mimic dynamical systems, classify inputs, and store discrete sequences that correspond to the notes of a song. Finally, we use {FORCE} training to create two biologically motivated model circuits. One is inspired by the zebra finch and successfully reproduces songbird singing. The second network is motivated by the hippocampus and is trained to store and replay a movie scene. {FORCE} trained networks reproduce behaviors comparable in complexity to their inspired circuits and yield information not easily obtainable with other techniques, such as behavioral responses to pharmacological manipulations and spike timing statistics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09049},
	abstract = {The way how recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons in the brain acquire powerful information processing capabilities through learning has remained a mystery. This lack of understanding is linked to a lack of learning algorithms for recurrent networks of spiking neurons ({RSNNs}) that are both functionally powerful and can be implemented by known biological mechanisms. Since {RSNNs} are simultaneously a primary target for implementations of brain-inspired circuits in neuromorphic hardware, this lack of algorithmic insight also hinders technological progress in that area. The gold standard for learning in recurrent neural networks in machine learning is back-propagation through time ({BPTT}), which implements stochastic gradient descent with regard to a given loss function. But {BPTT} is unrealistic from a biological perspective, since it requires a transmission of error signals backwards in time and in space, i.e., from post- to presynaptic neurons. We show that an online merging of locally available information during a computation with suitable top-down learning signals in real-time provides highly capable approximations to {BPTT}. For tasks where information on errors arises only late during a network computation, we enrich locally available information through feedforward eligibility traces of synapses that can easily be computed in an online manner. The resulting new generation of learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks provides a new understanding of network learning in the brain that can be tested experimentally. In addition, these algorithms provide eﬃcient methods for on-chip training of {RSNNs} in neuromorphic hardware.},

We show that {iSPN} plasticity prevents successful learning, as it reinforces activity patterns associated with negative outcomes. However, this pathological behavior is reversed if functionally opponent {dSPNs} and {iSPNs}, which promote and suppress the current behavior, are simultaneously activated by efferent input following action selection. This prediction is supported by striatal recordings and contrasts with prior models of {SPN} representations.

            The subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) is a major neuromodulation target for the alleviation of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms using deep brain stimulation ({DBS}). {STN}-{DBS} is today applied as treatment in Parkinson´s disease, dystonia, essential tremor, and obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}). {STN}-{DBS} also shows promise as a treatment for refractory Tourette syndrome. However, the internal organization of the {STN} has remained elusive and challenges researchers and clinicians: How can this small brain structure engage in the multitude of functions that renders it a key hub for therapeutic intervention of a variety of brain disorders ranging from motor to affective to cognitive? Based on recent gene expression studies of the {STN}, a comprehensive view of the anatomical and cellular organization, including revelations of spatio-molecular heterogeneity, is now possible to outline. In this review, we focus attention to the neurobiological architecture of the {STN} with specific emphasis on molecular patterns discovered within this complex brain area. Studies from human, non-human primate, and rodent brains now reveal anatomically defined distribution of specific molecular markers. Together their spatial patterns indicate a heterogeneous molecular architecture within the {STN}. Considering the translational capacity of targeting the {STN} in severe brain disorders, the addition of molecular profiling of the {STN} will allow for advancement in precision of clinical {STN}-based interventions.},

	abstract = {A wealth of research focuses on the decision-making processes that animals and humans employ when selecting actions in the face of reward and punishment. Initially such work stemmed from psychological investigations of conditioned behavior, and explanations of these in terms of computational models. Increasingly, analysis at the computational level has drawn on ideas from reinforcement learning, which provide a normative framework within which decision-making can be analyzed. More recently, the fruits of these extensive lines of research have made contact with investigations into the neural basis of decision making. Converging evidence now links reinforcement learning to specific neural substrates, assigning them precise computational roles. Specifically, electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals and functional imaging of human decision-making have revealed in the brain the existence of a key reinforcement learning signal, the temporal difference reward prediction error. Here, we first introduce the formal reinforcement learning framework. We then review the multiple lines of evidence linking reinforcement learning to the function of dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian midbrain and to more recent data from human imaging experiments. We further extend the discussion to aspects of learning not associated with phasic dopamine signals, such as learning of goal-directed responding that may not be dopamine-dependent, and learning about the vigor (or rate) with which actions should be performed that has been linked to tonic aspects of dopaminergic signaling. We end with a brief discussion of some of the limitations of the reinforcement learning framework, highlighting questions for future research.},

However, the functional roles of this complex remain to be fully elucidated. Here we have examined whether the {CM}-Pf complex is involved in the process of covert attention. We trained two macaque monkeys to perform a task in which a visual target stimulus for button release appeared at either the same location as the preceding visual instruction cue (a “validly cued target”) or a location on the opposite side (an “invalidly cued target”). Reaction times ({RTs}) to a validly cued target were significantly shorter than those to an invalidly cued target, leading to a “validity effect” of about 20 ms. We recorded the activity of 97 neurons in the {CM}-Pf while the monkeys performed the attention task with the hand that was contralateral to the neuronal recording. Seventy {CM}-Pf neurons showed task-related activity after the appearance of either the instruction cue or the target stimulus: 33 neurons responded with a prominent short-latency facilitation ({SLF}), whereas 37 responded with a short-latency suppression followed by a long-latency facilitation ({LLF}). Most of the {SLF} neurons responded preferentially to a cue appearing on the contralateral side (76\%) and to an invalidly cued target appearing on the contralateral side (61\%). In contrast, {LLF} neurons showed a short-latency suppression after the cue stimulus, regardless of whether the cue appeared on the contra- or ipsilateral side (84\%). Inactivating the {CM}-Pf complex by local injection (1 μl) of the {GABA}
              A
              receptor agonist muscimol (1–5 μg/μl) resulted in a significant increase in the {RT} to a validly cued target presented on the contra- but not the ipsilateral side. In contrast, inactivating the {CM}-Pf complex did not affect {RTs} to invalidly cued targets on either the contra- or the ipsilateral side. Thus the validity effect was abolished only on the contralateral side. We conclude that the {CM}-Pf complex plays a specific and essential role in the process of attentional orienting to external events occurring on the contralateral side, probably through the projection of primary outputs to the striatum, which is involved in the action-selection mechanisms of the basal ganglia.},

However, over the past decade, signiﬁcant advances have led to a deeper understanding of the anatomical, electrophysiological, behavioral and pathological aspects of the thalamostriatal system. The cloning of the vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 ({vGluT}1 and {vGluT}2) has provided powerful tools to differentiate thalamostriatal from corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals, allowing us to carry out comparative studies of the synaptology and plasticity of these two systems in normal and pathological conditions. Findings from these studies have led to the recognition of two thalamostriatal systems, based on their differential origin from the caudal intralaminar nuclear group, the center median/parafascicular ({CM}/Pf) complex, or other thalamic nuclei. The recent use of optogenetic methods supports this model of the organization of the thalamostriatal systems, showing differences in functionality and glutamate receptor localization at thalamostriatal synapses from Pf and other thalamic nuclei. At the functional level, evidence largely gathered from thalamic recordings in awake monkeys strongly suggests that the thalamostriatal system from the {CM}/Pf is involved in regulating alertness and switching behaviors. Importantly, there is evidence that the caudal intralaminar nuclei and their axonal projections to the striatum partly degenerate in {PD} and that {CM}/Pf deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) may be therapeutically useful in several movement disorders.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              In primates, including humans, the centromedian/parafascicular ({CM}-Pf) complex is a key thalamic node of the basal ganglia system. Deep brain stimulation in {CM}-Pf has been applied for the treatment of motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease or Tourette syndrome. Rodents have become widely used models for the study of the cellular and genetic mechanisms of these and other motor disorders. However, the equivalence between the primate {CM}-Pf and the nucleus regarded as analogous in rodents (Parafascicular, Pf) remains unclear.
            
            
              Methods
              Here, we analyzed the neurochemical architecture and carried out a brain-wide mapping of the input–output motifs in the mouse Pf at micropopulation level using anterograde and retrograde labeling methods. Specifically, we mapped and quantified the sources of cortical and subcortical input to different Pf subregions, and mapped and compared the distribution and terminal structure of their axons.
            
            
              Results
              We found that projections to Pf arise predominantly (\&gt;75\%) from the cerebral cortex, with an unusually strong (\&gt;45\%) Layer 5b component, which is, in part, contralateral. The intermediate layers of the superior colliculus are the main subcortical input source to Pf. On its output side, Pf neuron axons predominantly innervate the striatum. In a sparser fashion, they innervate other basal ganglia nuclei, including the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}), and the cerebral cortex. Differences are evident between the lateral and medial portions of Pf, both in chemoarchitecture and in connectivity. Lateral Pf axons innervate territories of the striatum, {STN} and cortex involved in the sensorimotor control of different parts of the contralateral hemibody. In contrast, the mediodorsal portion of Pf innervates oculomotor-limbic territories in the above three structures.
            
            
              Discussion
              Our data thus indicate that the mouse Pf consists of several neurochemically and connectively distinct domains whose global organization bears a marked similarity to that described in the primate {CM}-Pf complex.},

The thalamostriatal projection is highly heterogeneous originating in many subnuclei of the thalamus including the midline ({ML}) and intralaminar ({IL}) nuclei. We examined the dendritic morphology and axonal trajectory of 15 {ML} and 11 {IL} neurons by single-neuron labeling with viral vectors in combination with mu-opioid receptor immunostaining in rat brains. Dendritic and axonal morphology deﬁned {ML} neurons as type {II} cells consisting of at least two subclasses according to the presence or absence of striatal axon collaterals. In the striatum, {ML} neurons preferentially innervated striosomes, whereas parafascicular neurons preferentially innervated the matrix. Almost all single thalamostriatal neurons favoring striosome or matrix compartments also innervated the cerebral cortical areas that supplied cortical input to the same striatal compartment. We thus revealed that thalamostriatal projections are highly organized 1) by the similarity in morphological characteristics and 2) their preference for the striatal compartments and cortical areas. These ﬁndings demonstrate that the functional properties of striatal compartments are inﬂuenced by both their cortical and thalamic afferents presumably with a different time latency and support selective dynamics for the striosome and matrix compartments.},

We argue that two pieces of this puzzle were provided by experimental data from neuroscience. A mathematical result tells us how these pieces need to be combined to enable biologically plausible online network learning through gradient descent, in particular deep reinforcement learning. This learning method–called e-prop–approaches the performance of backpropagation through time ({BPTT}), the best-known method for training recurrent neural networks in machine learning.

	abstract = {The nature and origin of the temporal irregularity in the electrical activity of cortical neurons in vivo are not well understood. We consider the hypothesis that this irregularity is due to a balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents into the cortical cells. We study a network model with excitatory and inhibitory populations of simple binary units. The internal feedback is mediated by relatively large synaptic strengths, so that the magnitude of the total excitatory and inhibitory feedback is much larger than the neuronal threshold. The connectivity is random and sparse. The mean number of connections per unit is large, though small compared to the total number of cells in the network. The network also receives a large, temporally regular input from external sources. We present an analytical solution of the mean-field theory of this model, which is exact in the limit of large network size. This theory reveals a new cooperative stationary state of large networks, which we term a balanced state. In this state, a balance between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs emerges dynamically for a wide range of parameters, resulting in a net input whose temporal fluctuations are of the same order as its mean. The internal synaptic inputs act as a strong negative feedback, which linearizes the population responses to the external drive despite the strong nonlinearity of the individual cells. This feedback also greatly stabilizes the system's state and enables it to track a time-dependent input on time scales much shorter than the time constant of a single cell. The spatiotemporal statistics of the balanced state are calculated. It is shown that the autocorrelations decay on a short time scale, yielding an approximate Poissonian temporal statistics. The activity levels of single cells are broadly distributed, and their distribution exhibits a skewed shape with a long power-law tail. The chaotic nature of the balanced state is revealed by showing that the evolution of the microscopic state of the network is extremely sensitive to small deviations in its initial conditions. The balanced state generated by the sparse, strong connections is an asynchronous chaotic state. It is accompanied by weak spatial cross-correlations, the strength of which vanishes in the limit of large network size. This is in contrast to the synchronized chaotic states exhibited by more conventional network models with high connectivity of weak synapses.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the basal ganglia ({BG}) play a key role in action selection and reinforcement learning. However, despite considerable number of studies, the {BG} architecture and function are not completely understood. Action selection and reinforcement learning are facilitated by the activity of dopaminergic neurons, which encode reward prediction errors when reward outcomes are higher or lower than expected. The {BG} are thought to select proper motor responses by gating appropriate actions, and suppressing inappropriate ones. The direct striato-nigral ({GO}) and the indirect striato-pallidal ({NOGO}) pathways have been suggested to provide the functions of {BG} in the two-pathway concept. Previous models conﬁrmed the idea that these two pathways can mediate the behavioral choice, but only for a relatively small number of potential behaviors. Recent studies have provided new evidence of {BG} involvement in motor adaptation tasks, in which adaptation occurs in a non-error-based manner. In such tasks, there is a continuum of possible actions, each represented by a complex neuronal activity pattern. We extended the classical concept of the two-pathway {BG} by creating a model of {BG} interacting with a movement execution system, which allows for an arbitrary number of possible actions. The model includes sensory and premotor cortices, {BG}, a spinal cord network, and a virtual mechanical arm performing 2D reaching movements. The arm is composed of 2 joints (shoulder and elbow) controlled by 6 muscles (4 mono-articular and 2 bi-articular). The spinal cord network contains motoneurons, controlling the muscles, and sensory interneurons that receive afferent feedback and mediate basic reﬂexes. Given a speciﬁc goal-oriented motor task, the {BG} network through reinforcement learning constructs a behavior from an arbitrary number of basic actions represented by cortical activity patterns. Our study conﬁrms that, with slight modiﬁcations, the classical two-pathway {BG} concept is consistent with results of previous studies, including non-error based motor adaptation experiments, pharmacological manipulations with {BG} nuclei, and functional deﬁcits observed in {BG}-related motor disorders.},

	abstract = {Echo state networks ({ESN}) are a novel approach to recurrent neural network training. An {ESN} consists of a large, fixed, recurrent "reservoir" network, from which the desired output is obtained by training suitable output connection weights. Determination of optimal output weights becomes a linear, uniquely solvable task of {MSE} minimization. This article reviews the basic ideas and describes an online adaptation scheme based on the {RLS} algorithm known from adaptive linear systems. As an example, a 10-th order {NARMA} system is adaptively identified. The known benefits of the {RLS} algorithms carryover from linear systems to nonlinear ones; specifically, the convergence rate and misadjustment can be determined at design time.},

              The cortico–basal ganglia–thalamo–cortical loop is one of the fundamental network motifs in the brain. Revealing its structural and functional organization is critical to understanding cognition, sensorimotor behaviour, and the natural history of many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Classically, this network is conceptualized to contain three information channels: motor, limbic and associative
              1–4
              . Yet this three-channel view cannot explain the myriad functions of the basal ganglia. We previously subdivided the dorsal striatum into 29 functional domains on the basis of the topography of inputs from the entire cortex
              5
              . Here we map the multi-synaptic output pathways of these striatal domains through the globus pallidus external part ({GPe}), substantia nigra reticular part ({SNr}), thalamic nuclei and cortex. Accordingly, we identify 14 {SNr} and 36 {GPe} domains and a direct cortico-{SNr} projection. The striatonigral direct pathway displays a greater convergence of striatal inputs than the more parallel striatopallidal indirect pathway, although direct and indirect pathways originating from the same striatal domain ultimately converge onto the same postsynaptic {SNr} neurons. Following the {SNr} outputs, we delineate six domains in the parafascicular and ventromedial thalamic nuclei. Subsequently, we identify six parallel cortico–basal ganglia–thalamic subnetworks that sequentially transduce specific subsets of cortical information through every elemental node of the cortico–﻿basal ganglia–thalamic loop. Thalamic domains relay this output back to the originating corticostriatal neurons of each subnetwork in a bona fide closed loop.},

	abstract = {This study proposes an adaptive control architecture based on an accurate regression method called Locally Weighted Projection Regression ({LWPR}) and on a bio-inspired module, such as a cerebellar-like engine. This hybrid architecture takes full advantage of the machine learning module ({LWPR} kernel) to abstract an optimized representation of the sensorimotor space while the cerebellar component integrates this to generate corrective terms in the framework of a control task. Furthermore, we illustrate how the use of a simple adaptive error feedback term allows to use the proposed architecture even in the absence of an accurate analytic reference model. The presented approach achieves an accurate control with low gain corrective terms (for compliant control schemes). We evaluate the contribution of the different components of the proposed scheme comparing the obtained performance with alternative approaches. Then, we show that the presented architecture can be used for accurate manipulation of different objects when their physical properties are not directly known by the controller. We evaluate how the scheme scales for simulated plants of high Degrees of Freedom (7-{DOFs}).},

The growing knowledge about the human brain enables us to design better computational models, and biologically inspired control structures allow us to test the underlying theories. Enhanced accuracy and precision on the part of the robot and a better understanding of the human brain are the benefits. One of the key structures in voluntary movements, coordination and posture, as well as motor learning, is the cerebellum, whose basic operating principle is information comparison of the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei. This work will give an overview over the structure and functioning of the cerebellum and the role of the forward model as predictor. Based on this, three different approaches will be presented to show how more biological inspired computational models can improve the motion accuracy of a robot.},

In this paper, we review the system-level neurocomputational models of the human motor system, and we focus on biomimetic models simulating the functional activity of the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, the motor cortex, and the spinal cord, which are the main central nervous system areas involved in the learning, execution, and control of movements. We review the models that have been proposed from the early of 1970s, when the first cerebellar model was realized, up to nowadays, when the embodiment of these models into robots acting in the real world and into software agents acting in a virtual environment has become of paramount importance to close the perception-cognition-action cycle. This review shows that neurocomputational models have contributed to the comprehension and reproduction of neural mechanisms underlying reaching movements, but much remains to be done because a whole model of the central nervous system controlling musculoskeletal robots is still missing.},

We will mathematically express as a fiber bundle the hypercolumnar organization of this cortical area, first modelled by Georgopoulos (Georgopoulos et al., 1982; Georgopoulos, 2015). On this structure, we will consider the selective tuning of M1 neurons of kinematic variables of positions and directions of movement. We will then extend this model to encode the notion of fragments introduced by Hatsopoulos et al. (2007) which describes the selectivity of neurons to movement direction varying in time. This leads to consider a higher dimensional geometrical structure where fragments are represented as integral curves. A comparison with the curves obtained through numerical simulations and experimental data will be presented. Moreover, neural activity shows coherent behaviours represented in terms of movement trajectories pointing to a specific pattern of movement decomposition Kadmon Harpaz et al. (2019). Here, we will recover this pattern through a spectral clustering algorithm in the subriemannian structure we introduced, and compare our results with the neurophysiological one of Kadmon Harpaz et al. (2019).},

	abstract = {Motor learning is accompanied by widespread changes within the motor cortex, but it is unknown whether these changes are ultimately funneled through a stable corticospinal output channel or if the corticospinal output itself is plastic. We investigated the consistency of the relationship between corticospinal neuron activity and movement through in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in mice learning a lever-press task. Corticospinal neurons exhibited heterogeneous correlations with movement, with the majority of movement-modulated neurons decreasing activity during movement. Individual cells changed their activity across days which led to novel associations between corticospinal activity and movement. Unlike previous observations in layer 2/3, activity accompanying learned movements did not become more consistent with learning, and instead the activity of dissimilar movements became more decorrelated. These results indicate that the relationship between corticospinal activity and movement is dynamic, and the types of activity and plasticity are different from and possibly complementary to layer 2/3.},

However, how neurons undergo synaptic changes and become recruited during motor learning to form a memory engram remains unknown. Here, we train mice on a motor learning task and use a genetic approach to identify and manipulate behavior-relevant neurons selectively in the primary motor cortex (M1). We ﬁnd that the degree of M1 engram neuron reactivation correlates with motor performance. We further demonstrate that learning-induced dendritic spine reorganization speciﬁcally occurs in these M1 engram neurons. In addition, we ﬁnd that motor learning leads to an increase in the strength of M1 engram neuron outputs onto striatal spiny projection neurons ({SPNs}) and that these synapses form clusters along {SPN} dendrites. These results identify a highly speciﬁc synaptic plasticity during the formation of long-lasting motor memory traces in the corticostriatal circuit.},

	abstract = {A key to motor control is the motor thalamus, where several inputs converge. One excitatory input originates from layer 5 of primary motor cortex (M1L5), while another arises from the deep cerebellar nuclei (Cb). M1L5 terminals distribute throughout the motor thalamus and overlap with {GABAergic} inputs from the basal ganglia output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus ({GPi}), and substantia nigra pars reticulata ({SNr}). In contrast, it is thought that Cb and basal ganglia inputs are segregated. Therefore, we hypothesized that one potential function of the {GABAergic} inputs from basal ganglia is to selectively inhibit, or gate, excitatory signals from M1L5 in the motor thalamus. Here, we tested this possibility and determined the circuit organization of mouse (both sexes) motor thalamus using an optogenetic strategy in acute slices. First, we demonstrated the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway from M1L5 through motor thalamus. Importantly, we discovered that {GABAergic} inputs from the {GPi} and {SNr} converge onto single motor thalamic cells with excitatory synapses from M1L5. Separately, we also demonstrate that, perhaps unexpectedly, {GABAergic} {GPi} and {SNr} inputs converge with those from the Cb. We interpret these results to indicate that a role of the basal ganglia is to gate the thalamic transmission of M1L5 and Cb information to cortex.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated somatosensory cortex involvement in motor learning and retention. However, the nature of its contribution is unknown. One possibility is that the somatosensory cortex is transiently engaged during movement. Alternatively, there may be durable learning-related changes which would indicate sensory participation in the encoding of learned movements. These possibilities are dissociated by disrupting the somatosensory cortex following learning, thus targeting learning-related changes which may have occurred. If changes to the somatosensory cortex contribute to retention, which, in effect, means aspects of newly learned movements are encoded there, disruption of this area once learning is complete should lead to an impairment. Participants were trained to make movements while receiving rotated visual feedback. The primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) were targeted for continuous theta-burst stimulation, while stimulation over the occipital cortex served as a control. Retention was assessed using active movement reproduction, or recognition testing, which involved passive movements produced by a robot. Disruption of the somatosensory cortex resulted in impaired motor memory in both tests. Suppression of the motor cortex had no impact on retention as indicated by comparable retention levels in control and motor cortex conditions. The effects were learning specific. When stimulation was applied to S1 following training with unrotated feedback, movement direction, the main dependent variable, was unaltered. Thus, the somatosensory cortex is part of a circuit that contributes to retention, consistent with the idea that aspects of newly learned movements, possibly learning-updated sensory states (new sensory targets) which serve to guide movement, may be encoded there.},

Here, we report a surprising relationship between movement and posture in primates: on a within-trial basis, the commands that hold the arm and finger at a target location depend on the mathematical integration of the commands that moved the limb to that location. Following damage to the corticospinal tract, both the move and hold period commands become more variable. However, the hold period commands retain their dependence on the integral of the move period commands. Thus, our data suggest that the postural controller possesses a feedforward module that uses move commands to calculate a component of hold commands. This computation may arise within an unknown subcortical system that integrates cortical commands to stabilize limb posture.},

Aiming to reveal potential neural control system compensation for external disturbances, we applied an external orientation perturbation while monkeys performed an orientation reaching task and simultaneously recorded the neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1). We found that a subpopulation of neurons in the primary motor cortex specially created a time-locked activity in response to a “go” signal in the adaptation phase of the impending orientation perturbation and did not react to a “go” signal under the normal task condition without perturbation. Such neuronal activity was ampliﬁed as the alteration was processed and retained in the extinction phase; then, the activity gradually faded out. The increases in activity during the adaptation to the orientation perturbation may prepare the system for the impending response. Our work provides important evidence for understanding how the motor cortex responds to external perturbations and should advance research about the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor learning and adaptation.},

            Although the motor cortex has been found to be modulated by sensory or cognitive sequences, the linkage between multiple movement elements and sequence-related responses is not yet understood. Here, we recorded neuronal activity from the motor cortex with implanted micro-electrode arrays and single electrodes while monkeys performed a double-reach task that was instructed by simultaneously presented memorized cues. We found that there existed a substantial multiplicative component jointly tuned to impending and subsequent reaches during preparation, then the coding mechanism transferred to an additive manner during execution. This multiplicative joint coding, which also spontaneously emerged in recurrent neural networks trained for double reach, enriches neural patterns for sequential movement, and might explain the linear readout of elemental movements.},

	title = {Role of motor cortex in coordinating multi-joint movements: Is it time for a new paradigm?},
	volume = {78},
	abstract = {Reaching movements to spatial targets require motor patterns at the shoulder to be coordinated carefully with those at the elbow to smoothly move the hand through space. While the motor cortex is involved in this volitional task, considerable debate remains about how this cortical region participates in planning and controlling movement. This article reviews two opposing interpretations of motor cortical function during multi-joint movements. On the one hand, studies performed predominantly on single-joint movement generally support the notion that motor cortical activity is intimately involved in generating motor patterns at a given joint. In contrast, studies on reaching demonstrate correlations between motor cortical activity and features of movement related to the hand, suggesting that the motor cortex may be involved in more global features of the task. Although this latter paradigm involves a multi-joint motor task in which neural activity is correlated with features of movement related to the hand, this neural activity is also correlated to other movement variables. Therefore it is difficult to assess if and how the motor cortex contributes to the coordination of motor patterns at different joints. In particular, present paradigms cannot assess whether motor cortical activity contributes to the control of one joint or multiple joints during whole-arm tasks. The final point discussed in this article is the development of a new experimental device ({KINARM}) that can both monitor and manipulate the mechanics of the shoulder and elbow independently during multi-joint motor tasks. It is hoped that this new device will provide a new approach for examining how the motor cortex is involved in motor coordination.},

The reasons for these different effects have been a major topic of debate among social– cognitive and perceptual control theorists. In particular, the findings of various self-efficacy effects has been motivated by a perceptual control theory view of self-regulation that social– cognitive theorists’ question. To provide more clarity to the theoretical arguments, a computational model of the multiple processes presumed to create the positive, negative, and null effects for self-efficacy is presented. Building on an existing computational model of goal choice that produces a positive effect for self-efficacy, the current article adds a symbolic processing structure used during goal striving that explains the negative self-efficacy effect observed in recent studies. Moreover, the multiple processes, operating together, allow the model to recreate the various effects found in a published study of feedback ambiguity’s moderating role on the self-efficacy to performance relationship (Schmidt \& {DeShon}, 2010). Discussion focuses on the implications of the model for the self-efficacy debate, alternative computational models, the overlap between control theory and social– cognitive theory explanations, the value of using computational models for resolving theoretical disputes, and future research and directions the model inspires.},

	abstract = {The development of a sense of agency is indispensable for a cognitive entity (biological or artiﬁcial) to become a cognitive agent. In developmental psychology, researchers have taken inspiration from adult cognitive psychology and neuroscience literature and use the comparator model to assess the presence of a sense of agency in early infancy. Similarly, robotics researchers have taken components of the proposed mechanism in attempts to build a sense of agency into artiﬁcial systems. In this article, we identify an invalidating theoretical ﬂaw in the reasoning underlying this conversion from adult studies to developmental science and cognitive systems research, rooted in an oversight in the conceptualization of the comparator model as currently used in experimental practice. In these experiments, the emphasis has been put solely on testing for a match between predicted and observed sensory consequences. We argue that the match by itself can exclusively generate a simple categorization or a representation of equality between predicted and observed sensory consequences, both of which are insufﬁcient to generate the causal representations required for a sense of agency. Consequently, the comparator model, as it has been described in the context of the sense of agency and as it is commonly used in experimental designs, is insufﬁcient to generate the sense of agency: infants and robots require more than developing the ability to match predicted and observed sensory consequences for a sense of agency. We conclude with outlining possible solutions and future directions for researchers in developmental science and artiﬁcial intelligence.},

This network is greatly expanded in primates compared to other mammals and coevolved with glabrous hands with opposable thumbs and the extraordinary dexterous behaviors employed by a number of primates, including humans. To examine this, we reversibly deactivated the primary motor area (M1), anterior parietal area 2, and posterior parietal areas 5L and 7b individually while monkeys were performing two types of reaching and grasping tasks. Reversible deactivation was accomplished with small microﬂuidic thermal regulators abutting speciﬁcally targeted cortical areas. Placement of these devices in the different cortical ﬁelds was conﬁrmed post hoc in histologically processed tissue. Our results indicate that the different areas examined form a complex network of motor control that is overlapping. However, several consistent themes emerged that suggest the independent roles that motor cortex, area 2, area 7b, and area 5L play in the motor planning and execution of reaching and grasping movements. Area 5L is involved in the early stages and area 7b the later stages of a reaching and grasping movement, motor cortex is involved in all aspects of the execution of the movement, and area 2 provides proprioceptive feedback throughout the movement. We discuss our results in the context of previous studies that explored the fronto-parietal network, the overlapping (but also independent) functions of different nodes of this network, and the rapid compensatory plasticity of this network.},

Although there is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far it has always been used for a speciﬁc purpose such as implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings, exposing a signiﬁcant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman’s equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution impacts learning in the approximate setting.},

When sampled probabilistically, these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce randomness in the observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with our theoretical formulation. Finally, we evaluate this new algorithm on the Atari 2600 games, observing that it signiﬁcantly outperforms many of the recent improvements on {DQN}, including the related distributional algorithm C51.},

Rather, it can be decomposed into three computationally and neuroanatomically distinct factors that were evident in human subjects performing a spatial-prediction task: (1) surprisedriven belief updating, related to {BOLD} activity in visual cortex; (2) uncertainty-driven belief updating, related to anterior prefrontal and parietal activity; and (3) reward-driven belief updating, a contextinappropriate behavioral tendency related to activity in ventral striatum. These distinct factors converged in a core system governing adaptive learning. This system, which included dorsomedial frontal cortex, responded to all three factors and predicted belief updating both across trials and across individuals.},

Midbrain cholinergic neurons from the pedunculopontine nucleus ({PPN}) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus ({LDT}) provide dense innervation of the thalamus, but a detailed connectivity mapping is missing. Using conditional tracing of midbrain cholinergic axons in the rat, together with a detailed segmentation of thalamic structures, we show that projections arising in {PPN} and {LDT} are topographically organized along the entire extent of the thalamus. {PPN} cholinergic neurons preferentially innervate thalamic relay structures, whereas {LDT} cholinergic neurons preferentially target thalamic limbic nuclei. Moreover, both {PPN} and {LDT} provide a dense innervation of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Notably, we observe a differential synaptic density that functionally dissociates between {PPN} and {LDT} innervation. Our results show that midbrain cholinergic neurons innervate virtually all thalamic structures and this innervation is functionally segregated.},

This issue is present when attempting to reuse options to solve different tasks in the same domain. If instead of a value function, a successor representation is learned for some ﬁxed dynamics, then any value function deﬁned on any linear reward function can be computed efﬁciently. This setting can be particularly useful for reusing options in some hierarchical planning settings. Unfortunately, even linear parametrization of successor representation require a quadratic number of parameters with respect to the number of features and as many operations per temporal difference update step. We present a simple temporal difference-like algorithm for learning an approximate version of the successor representation with an amortized runtime O(nk) for n features and the maximum rank-k of the approximation. Preliminary results indicate that the rank parameter can be much smaller than the number of features.},

The successor map represents the expected future state occupancy from any given state and the reward predictor maps states to scalar rewards. The value function of a state can be computed as the inner product between the successor map and the reward weights. In this paper, we present {DSR}, which generalizes {SR} within an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework. {DSR} has several appealing properties including: increased sensitivity to distal reward changes due to factorization of reward and world dynamics, and the ability to extract bottleneck states (subgoals) given successor maps trained under a random policy.

	title = {Transfer in Deep Reinforcement Learning Using Successor Features and Generalised Policy Improvement},
	abstract = {The ability to transfer skills across tasks has the potential to scale up reinforcement learning ({RL}) agents to environments currently out of reach. Recently, a framework based on two ideas, successor features ({SFs}) and generalised policy improvement ({GPI}), has been introduced as a principled way of transferring skills. In this paper we extend the {SF}\&{GPI} framework in two ways. One of the basic assumptions underlying the original formulation of {SF}\&{GPI} is that rewards for all tasks of interest can be computed as linear combinations of a ﬁxed set of features. We relax this constraint and show that the theoretical guarantees supporting the framework can be extended to any set of tasks that only differ in the reward function. Our second contribution is to show that one can use the reward functions themselves as features for future tasks, without any loss of expressiveness, thus removing the need to specify a set of features beforehand. This makes it possible to combine {SF}\&{GPI} with deep learning in a more stable way. We empirically verify this claim on a complex 3D environment where observations are images from a ﬁrst-person perspective. We show that the transfer promoted by {SF}\&{GPI} leads to very good policies on unseen tasks almost instantaneously. We also describe how to learn policies specialised to the new tasks in a way that allows them to be added to the agent’s set of skills, and thus be reused in the future.},

In particular, we are interested in solutions to this problem that do not require localization, mapping or planning. Additionally, we require that our solution can quickly adapt to new situations (e.g., changing navigation goals and environments). To meet these criteria we frame this problem as a sequence of related reinforcement learning tasks. We propose a successor-feature-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn to transfer knowledge from previously mastered navigation tasks to new problem instances. Our algorithm substantially decreases the required learning time after the ﬁrst task instance has been solved, which makes it easily adaptable to changing environments. We validate our method in both simulated and real robot experiments with a Robotino and compare it to a set of baseline methods including classical planning-based navigation.},

Speciﬁcally, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations that encode diffusive information ﬂow in the environment. We extend the existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available. We propose an algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state representations from raw pixels.

@article{machadoTemporalAbstractionReinforcement,
	title = {Temporal Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning with the Successor Representation},
	abstract = {Reasoning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is one of the key attributes of intelligence. In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at diﬀerent levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no deﬁnitive answers for which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results, showing how the successor representation can be used to discover options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option discovery in which the agent’s representation is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the options are constantly reﬁned based on each other. Beyond option discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended exploration and on the use of the successor representation to combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions involved in the deﬁnition of options and demonstrate the synergy of diﬀerent methods based on the successor representation, such as eigenoptions and the option keyboard.},

Receptive fields in the hand, mouth, and foot representations of cortical areas 3a, 3b, and 1 were mapped by multiunit recording; and small volumes of distinguishable anterograde tracers were injected into different body-part representations in single {SI} areas. 2. Analysis of labeled projections established that at least four types of systematic remapping occur in the primate corticostriatal system. 1) An area of cortex representing a single body part sends fibers that diverge to innervate multiple regions in the putamen, forming branching, patchy fields that are densest in the lateral putamen. The fields do not form elongated cylindrical forms; rather, they are nearly as extended mediolaterally as they are rostrocaudally. 2) Cortical regions representing hand, mouth, and foot send globally somatotopic, nonoverlapping projections to the putamen, but regions with closely related representations (such as those of the thumb and 5th finger in area 3b) send convergent, overlapping corticostriatal projections. The overlap is fairly precise in the caudal putamen, but in the rostral putamen the densest zones of the projections do not overlap. 3) Regions representing homologous body parts in different {SI} cortical areas send projections that converge in the putamen. This was true of paired projections from areas 3a and 3b, and from areas 3b and 1. Thus corticostriatal inputs representing distinct somatosensory submodalities can project to the same local regions within the striatum. Convergence is not always complete, however: in the rostral putamen of two cases comparing projections from areas 3a and 1, the densest zones of the projections did not overlap. 4) All projections from {SI} avoid striosomes and innervate discrete zones within the matrix. 3. These experiments demonstrate that the somatosensory representations of the body are reorganized as they are projected from {SI} to the somatosensory sector of the primate putamen. This remapping suggests that the striatal representation of the body may be functionally distinct from that of each area of {SI}. The patchy projections may provide a basis for redistribution of somatosensory information to discrete output systems in the basal ganglia. Transformations in the corticostriatal system could thus be designed for modulating different movement-related programs.},

            Consensus is rapidly building to support a role for the cerebellum beyond motor function, but its contributions to non-motor learning remain poorly understood. Here, we provide behavioral, anatomical and computational evidence to demonstrate a causal role for the primate posterior lateral cerebellum in learning new visuomotor associations. Reversible inactivation of the posterior lateral cerebellum of male monkeys impeded the learning of new visuomotor associations, but had no effect on movement parameters, or on well-practiced performance of the same task. Using retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus, we identified a distinct cerebro-cerebellar network linking Purkinje cells in the posterior lateral cerebellum with a region of the prefrontal cortex that is critical in learning visuomotor associations. Together, these results demonstrate a causal role for the primate posterior lateral cerebellum in non-motor, reinforcement learning.},

Theoretical studies postulate that this subjective experience is developed through multistep processes extending from the sensorimotor to the cognitive level. However, it remains unclear how the brain processes such different levels of information and constitutes the neural substrates for the sense of agency. To answer this question, we combined two strategies: an experimental paradigm, in which self-agency gradually evolves according to sensorimotor experience, and a multivoxel pattern analysis. The combined strategies revealed that the sensorimotor, posterior parietal, anterior insula, and higher visual cortices contained information on self-other attribution during movement. In addition, we investigated whether the found regions showed a preference for self-other attribution or for sensorimotor information. As a result, the right supramarginal gyrus, a portion of the inferior parietal lobe ({IPL}), was found to be the most sensitive to self-other attribution among the found regions, while the bilateral precentral gyri and left {IPL} dominantly ref lected sensorimotor information. Our results demonstrate that multiple brain regions are involved in the development of the sense of agency and that these show specific preferences for different levels of information.},

            Non-motor aspects in dystonia are now well recognized. The sense of agency, which refers to the experience of controlling one's own actions, has been scarcely studied in dystonia, even though its disturbances can contribute to movement disorders. Among various brain structures, the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia are involved in shaping the sense of agency. In myoclonus dystonia, resulting from a dysfunction of the motor network, an altered sense of agency may contribute to the clinical phenotype of the condition. In this study, we compared the explicit and implicit sense of agency in patients with myoclonus dystonia caused by a pathogenic variant of {SGCE} ({DYT}-{SGCE}) and control participants. We utilized behavioural tasks to assess the sense of agency and performed neuroimaging analyses, including structural, resting-state functional connectivity, and dynamic causal modelling, to explore the relevant brain regions involved in the sense of agency. Additionally, we examined the relationship between behavioural performance, symptom severity, and neuroimaging findings. We compared 19 patients with {DYT}-{SGCE} and 24 healthy volunteers. Our findings revealed that patients with myoclonus-dystonia exhibited a specific impairment in explicit sense of agency, particularly when implicit motor learning was involved. However, their implicit sense of agency remained intact. These patients also displayed grey-matter abnormalities in the motor cerebellum, as well as increased functional connectivity between the cerebellum and pre-supplementary motor area. Dynamic causal modelling analysis further identified reduced inhibitory effects of the cerebellum on the pre-supplementary motor area, decreased excitatory effects of the pre-supplementary motor area on the cerebellum, and increased self-inhibition within the pre-supplementary motor area. Importantly, both cerebellar grey-matter alterations and functional connectivity abnormalities between the cerebellum and pre-supplementary motor area were found to correlate with explicit sense of agency impairment. Increased self-inhibition within the pre-supplementary motor area was associated with less severe myoclonus symptoms. These findings highlight the disruption of higher-level cognitive processes in patients with myoclonus-dystonia, further expanding the spectrum of neurological and psychiatric dysfunction already identified in this disorder.},

The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the ﬁeld of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent ﬁndings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.},

            Controlling an event through one’s own action usually induces a sense of agency, a feeling that arises when an expected outcome matches the intention. The neural correlates of this feeling remain controversial however, as experimental manipulation of the action-outcome chain often introduces mismatch or prediction errors that strongly correlate with the sense of agency. Here, we took a different approach and manipulated the causal belief (self-attribution vs. computer-attribution) by external cues during matched visuo-motor tapping conditions. With magneto-encephalography, we studied the sense of agency from a network perspective, investigating in source space the modulation of local population activity and changes in functional connectivity with motor cortex. Our results show that during the belief of agency primary motor cortex (M1) shows stronger functional connectivity (mediated by the beta band) to inferior parietal lobe and right middle temporal gyrus ({MTG}). Furthermore, the local feed-forward activity (gamma band power) in extrastriate body area and {MTG} disappears with that belief. After changes in action context, left M1 shows stronger connectivity in the alpha band with right premotor cortex and left insular-temporal cortex a network that might support active inference in social action context. Finally, a better tapping performance in this rhythmic task was related to alpha power modulations in the bilateral cerebellum and bilateral fusiform body-area, with power suppression during a more precise performance. These findings highlight the role of multiple networks supporting the sense of agency by changing their relative contribution for different causal beliefs.},

In this work, we propose to use the Beta distribution as an alternative and analyze the bias and variance of the policy gradients of both policies. We show that the Beta policy is bias-free and provides signiﬁcantly faster convergence and higher scores over the Gaussian policy when both are used with trust region policy optimization ({TRPO}) and actor critic with experience replay ({ACER}), the state-of-the-art on- and offpolicy stochastic methods respectively, on {OpenAI} Gym’s and {MuJoCo}’s continuous control environments.},

Here, we fill this gap by jointly comparing participants’ estimates of the interval between three types of triggering events with comparable predictability -voluntary movement, passive movement, external sensory event- and an external sensory outcome (auditory or visual across experiments). Results failed to show intentional binding, i.e., no shorter interval estimation for the voluntary than the passive movement conditions. Instead, we observed substantial temporal (but not intentional) binding when comparing both movement conditions to the external sensory condition. Thus, temporal binding seems to originate from sensory integration and temporal prediction, not from action intention.},

Mechanisms of adaptation, a ubiquitous feature of sensory systems, allow for the accommodation of this range of scales. Are there common rules of adaptation across different sensory modalities? We measured the membrane potential responses of individual neurons in the visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortices of male and female mice to discrete, punctate stimuli delivered at a wide range of fixed and nonfixed frequencies. We find that the adaptive profile of the response is largely preserved across these three areas, exhibiting attenuation and responses to the cessation of stimulation, which are signatures of response to changes in stimulus statistics. We demonstrate that these adaptive responses can emerge from a simple model based on the integration of fixed filters operating over multiple time scales.

              Our recent sensations affect our current expectations and perceptions of the environment. Neural correlates of this process exist throughout the brain and are loosely termed adaptation. Adaptive processes have been described across sensory cortices, but direct comparisons of these processes have not been possible because paradigms have been tailored specifically for each modality. We developed a common stimulus set that was used to characterize adaptation in somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortex. We describe here the similarities and differences in adaptation across these cortical areas and demonstrate that adaptive responses may emerge from a set of static filters that operate over a broad range of timescales.},

Inhibitory plasticity increases the inhibition onto excitatory neurons tuned to familiar stimuli, while inhibition for novel stimuli remains low, leading to a network novelty response. The generation of novelty responses does not depend on the periodicity but rather on the distribution of presented stimuli. By including tuning of inhibitory neurons, the network further captures stimulus-specific adaptation. Finally, we suggest that disinhibition can control the amplification of novelty responses. Therefore, inhibitory plasticity provides a flexible, biologically plausible mechanism to detect the novelty of bottom-up stimuli, enabling us to make experimentally testable predictions.},

	abstract = {Millions of people suffer from dopamine-related disorders spanning disturbances in movement, cognition and emotion. These changes are often attributed to changes in striatal dopamine function. Thus, understanding how dopamine signalling in the striatum and basal ganglia shapes human behaviour is fundamental to advancing the treatment of affected patients. Dopaminergic neurons innervate large-scale brain networks, and accordingly, many different roles for dopamine signals have been proposed, such as invigoration of movement and tracking of reward contingencies. The canonical circuit architecture of cortico-striatal loops sparks the question, of whether dopamine signals in the basal ganglia serve an overarching computational principle. Such a holistic understanding of dopamine functioning could provide new insights into symptom generation in psychiatry to neurology. Here, we review the perspective that dopamine could bidirectionally control neural population dynamics, increasing or decreasing their strength and likelihood to reoccur in the future, a process previously termed neural reinforcement. We outline how the basal ganglia pathways could drive strengthening and weakening of circuit dynamics and discuss the implication of this hypothesis on the understanding of motor signs of Parkinson’s disease ({PD}), the most frequent dopaminergic disorder. We propose that loss of dopamine in {PD} may lead to a pathological brain state where repetition of neural activity leads to weakening and instability, possibly explanatory for the fact that movement in {PD} deteriorates with repetition. Finally, we speculate on how therapeutic interventions such as deep brain stimulation may be able to reinstate reinforcement signals and thereby improve treatment strategies for {PD} in the future.},

Through a demonstration, we can gain direct knowledge about which actions need to be performed and which goals they have. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to imitation learning that tackles the challenges of a robot imitating a human, such as the change in perspective and body schema. Our approach can use a single human demonstration to abstract information about the demonstrated task, and use that information to generalise and replicate it. We facilitate this ability by a new integration of two state-of-the-art methods: a diffusion action segmentation model to abstract temporal information from the demonstration and an open vocabulary object detector for spatial information. Furthermore, we refine the abstracted information and use symbolic reasoning to create an action plan utilising inverse kinematics, to allow the robot to imitate the demonstrated action.},

When humans teach other humans how to perform actions, they often demonstrate the actions and the learning human can try to imitate the demonstration. Being able to mentally transfer from a demonstration seen from a third-person perspective to how it should look from a first-person perspective is fundamental for this ability in humans. As this is a challenging task, it is often simplified for robots by creating a demonstration in the first-person perspective. Creating these demonstrations requires more effort but allows for an easier imitation. We introduce a novel diffusion model aimed at enabling the robot to directly learn from the third-person demonstrations. Our model is capable of learning and generating the first-person perspective from the third-person perspective by translating the size and rotations of objects and the environment between two perspectives. This allows us to utilise the benefits of easy-toproduce third-person demonstrations and easy-to-imitate firstperson demonstrations. The model can either represent the first-person perspective in an {RGB} image or calculate the joint values. Our approach significantly outperforms other image-toimage models in this task.},

In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) from over a decade ago: {LSTMs} (1997) and {GRUs} (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time ({BPTT}), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, {LSTMs} and {GRUs} no longer need to {BPTT} and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions ({minLSTMs} and {minGRUs}) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175× faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old {RNNs} match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.},

We fine tune this model to obtain a Searchformer, a Transformer model that optimally solves previously unseen Sokoban puzzles 93.7\% of the time, while using up to 26.8\% fewer search steps than the \$A{\textasciicircum}*\$ implementation that was used for training initially. In our training method, \$A{\textasciicircum}*\$'s search dynamics are expressed as a token sequence outlining when task states are added and removed into the search tree during symbolic planning. Searchformer significantly outperforms baselines that predict the optimal plan directly with a 5-10\${\textbackslash}times\$ smaller model size and a 10\${\textbackslash}times\$ smaller training dataset.

	abstract = {Animals often demonstrate a remarkable ability to adapt to their environments during their lifetime. They do so partly due to the evolution of morphological and neural structures. These structures capture features of environments shared between generations to bias and speed up lifetime learning. In this work, we propose a computational model for studying a mechanism that can enable such a process. We adopt a computational framework based on meta reinforcement learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development. At the evolutionary scale, we evolve reservoirs, a family of recurrent neural networks that differ from conventional networks in that one optimizes not the synaptic weights, but hyperparameters controlling macro-level properties of the resulting network architecture. At the developmental scale, we employ these evolved reservoirs to facilitate the learning of a behavioral policy through Reinforcement Learning ({RL}). Within an {RL} agent, a reservoir encodes the environment state before providing it to an action policy. We evaluate our approach on several 2D and 3D simulated environments. Our results show that the evolution of reservoirs can improve the learning of diverse challenging tasks. We study in particular three hypotheses: the use of an architecture combining reservoirs and reinforcement learning could enable (1) solving tasks with partial observability, (2) generating oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks, and (3) facilitating the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unknown during the evolution phase.},

To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot’s motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method.

Here we show that changes in the way the brain processes somatosensory information in the ﬁrst year of life underlie the origins of this ability [3]. In three experiments we recorded somatosensory evoked potentials ({SEPs}) from 6.5-, 8-, and 10-month-old infants while presenting vibrotactile stimuli to their hands across uncrossed- and crossed-hands postures. At all ages we observed {SEPs} over central regions contralateral to the stimulated hand. Somatosensory processing was inﬂuenced by arm posture from 8 months onward. At 8 months, posture inﬂuenced mid-latency {SEP} components, but by 10 months effects were observed at early components associated with feedforward stages of somatosensory processing. Furthermore, sight of the hands was a necessary pre-requisite for somatosensory remapping at 10 months. Thus, the cortical networks [4] underlying the ability to dynamically update the location of a perceived touch across limb movements become functional during the ﬁrst year of life. Up until at least 6.5 months of age, it seems that human infants’ perceptions of tactile stimuli in the external environment are heavily dependent upon limb position.},

Sensorimotor networks are implicated in {SoA}, however little evidence exists on brain functionality during agency processing. Concurrently, it has been suggested that the brain's intrinsic resting-state (rs) activity has a preliminary influence on processing of agency cues. Here, we investigated the relation between performance in an agency attribution task and functional interactions among brain regions as derived by network analysis of rs functional magnetic resonance imaging. The action-effect delay was adaptively increased (range 90–1,620 ms) and behavioral measures correlated to indices of cognitive processes and appraised self-concepts. They were then regressed on local metrics of rs brain functional connectivity as to isolate the core areas enabling selfagency. Across subjects, the time window for self-agency was 90–625 ms, while the action-effect integration was impacted by self-evaluated personality traits. Neurally, the brain intrinsic organization sustaining consistency in self-agency attribution was characterized by high connectiveness in the secondary visual cortex, and regional segregation in the primary somatosensory area. Decreased connectiveness in the secondary visual area, regional segregation in the superior parietal lobule, and information control within a primary visual cortex-frontal eye fields network sustained self-agency over long-delayed effects. We thus demonstrate that self-agency is grounded on the intrinsic mode of brain function designed to organize information for visuomotor integration. Our observation is relevant for current models of psychopathology in clinical conditions in which both rs activity and sense of agency are altered.},

I use the example of infants’ reaching to illustrate how goal-directed action emerges from the intersection of seemingly distinct visual and proprioceptive-tactile-motor spaces that form in the early months following birth. The intersection of these two spaces begins with a casual contingent event involving vision and action: when the hand happens to contact a target. This event, which marks the onset of reaching, provides new behavioral value, reinforces the motor action, and intrinsically motivates infants to attempt to reproduce the behavior. Subsequent repeated cycles of perception and action lead to the exploration of a range of motor responses and a progressive alignment of the visual space with the proprioceptive-tactile-motor space, ultimately fostering the selection and refinement of increasingly successful and refined reaching patterns. Extensive hands-on experience in the environment and learning about the immediate outcomes of actions play a critical role in shaping behavioral development.},

	title = {Why Is Anything Conscious?},
	abstract = {We tackle the hard problem of consciousness taking the naturally-selected, selforganising, embodied organism as our starting point. We provide a mathematical formalism describing how biological systems self-organise to hierarchically interpret unlabelled sensory information according to valence and specific needs. Such interpretations imply behavioural policies which can only be differentiated from each other by the qualitative aspect of information processing. Selection pressures favour systems that can intervene in the world to achieve homeostatic and reproductive goals. Quality is a property arising in such systems to link cause to affect to motivate real world interventions. This produces a range of qualitative classifiers (interoceptive and exteroceptive) that motivate specific actions and determine priorities and preferences. Building upon the seminal distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness, our radical claim here is that phenomenal consciousness without access consciousness is likely very common, but the reverse is implausible. To put it provocatively: Nature does not like zombies. We formally describe the multilayered architecture of self-organisation from rocks to Einstein, illustrating how our argument applies in the real world. We claim that access consciousness at the human level is impossible without the ability to hierarchically model i) the self, ii) the world/others and iii) the self as modelled by others. Phenomenal consciousness is therefore required for human-level functionality. Our proposal lays the foundations of a formal science of consciousness, deeply connected with natural selection rather than abstract thinking, closer to human fact than zombie fiction.},

	abstract = {Temporal binding ({TB}) refers to an underestimation of time intervals between two events, most commonly for actions and their effects. This temporal contraction is measurable for both perceived changes in social stimuli such as faces, as well as for interactions with a partner. We investigated {TB} in two separate experiments to uncover the individual influences of (i) participants’ belief in an interaction with a human partner (as compared to a computer), and (ii) a face-like stimulus versus an abstract stimulus mediating the interaction. The results show that {TB} is more pronounced when self-initiated actions result in a personal event as opposed to a mere physical effect, being suggestive of a “social hyperbinding.” The social hyperbinding effect appeared to be driven both by the belief in interacting with another person and by a face-like stimulus. However, there seemed to be no further enhancing effect when combining the top-down processes (“beliefs”) with the bottom-up processes (“perceptions”). These findings suggest a prioritization of social information for {TB} regardless of whether this information is introduced by top-down (beliefs) or bottom-up information (stimuli). Our results add to existing literature demonstrating an increase in actionevent monitoring for social cues.},

Can we simply free us from the present set of rules or do we automatically adhere to them? How do rule violations inﬂuence subsequent behavior? To investigate the effects and aftereffects of violating simple S-R rule, we conducted three experiments that investigated continuous ﬁngertracking responses on an {iPad}. Our experiments show that rule violations are distinct from rule-based actions in both response times and movement trajectories, they take longer to initiate and execute, and their movement trajectory is heavily contorted. Data not only show differences between the two types of response (rule-based vs. violation), but also yielded a characteristic pattern of aftereffects in case of rule violations: rule violations do not trigger adaptation effects that render further rule violations less difﬁcult, but every rule violation poses repeated effort on the agent. The study represents a ﬁrst step towards understanding the signature and underlying mechanisms of deliberate rule violations, they cannot be acted out by themselves, but require the activation of the original rule ﬁrst. Consequently, they are best understood as reformulations of existing rules that are not accessible on their own, but need to be constantly derived from the original rule, with an addon that might entail an active tendency to steer away from mental representations that reﬂect (socially) unwanted behavior.},

In four experiments using the locus of slack- and the effect propagation-logic, we found conclusive evidence for effect anticipation taking place in the capacity-limited central bottleneck.

On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most approaches conceive of action planning as a mere continuation of stimulus processing, thus failing to account for the goal-directedness of even the simplest reaction in an experimental task. We propose a new framework for a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception and action planning, in which perceptual contents and action plans are coded in a common representational medium by feature codes with distal reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and to-be-produced events (actions) are equally represented by integrated, task-tuned networks of feature codes – cognitive structures we call event codes. We give an overview of evidence from a wide variety of empirical domains, such as spatial stimulus-response compatibility, sensorimotor synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that our main assumptions are well supported by the data.},

Here we show that merely labeling an action as rule violation induces substantial conﬂict between rule violation and compliance, as revealed by participants’ bias towards rule-complying motor actions. Moreover, conﬂict that comes with violating a rule was much stronger than conﬂict that comes with following an alternative rule, even if both decisions result in the same observable behavior. These observations open a new theoretical perspective on rule violation behavior, shifting the focus toward the cognitive processes operating during the very act of rule violation.},

The impact of an intermediate level of intentions – referring to action-contingent changes in the physical environment – is far less clear, however. We present three experiments that aim at scrutinizing this level of analysis by showing how such anticipated consequences affect movement trajectories. Participants steered a virtual avatar toward portals that displaced the avatar to a different but predictable location. Even though this displacement occurred only after the movement was completed, hand movements were clearly torn toward the anticipated ﬁnal location of the avatar. These results show that properties of anticipated action consequences leave a ﬁngerprint on movement trajectories and provide an opportunity to unite previous accounts on the relation of intentions and movements with general frameworks of action planning.},

Several studies reported a decreased number of {VENs} in neuropsychiatric diseases in which the “embodied” dimension of social cognition is markedly affected. Neuropathological analyses of {VENs} in patients with autism are few and did not report alterations in {VEN} numbers. In this study we re-evaluated the possible presence of changes in {VEN} numbers and their relationship with the diagnosis of autism. Using a stereologic approach we quantified {VENs} and pyramidal neurons in layer V of {FI} in postmortem brains of four young patients with autism and three comparably aged controls. We also investigated possible autism-related differences in {FI} layer V volume. Patients with autism consistently had a significantly higher ratio of {VENs} to pyramidal neurons (p = 0.020) than control subjects. This result may reflect the presence of neuronal overgrowth in young patients with autism and may also be related to alterations in migration, cortical lamination, and apoptosis. Higher numbers of {VENs} in the {FI} of patients with autism may also underlie a heightened interoception, described in some clinical observations.},
